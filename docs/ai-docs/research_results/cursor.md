# Research Synthesis: HashiCorp Vault + Ansible + Nomad Integration

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research using all available MCP tools, we've identified multiple high-quality, production-ready approaches for deploying HashiCorp Vault in Nomad clusters using Ansible automation. The research revealed that 2024 has brought significant advances in this integration pattern, particularly with Nomad 1.7's workload identity features and enhanced Ansible automation capabilities.

## Best Example Repository: **Skatteetaten/vagrant-hashistack**

**URL**: https://github.com/Skatteetaten/vagrant-hashistack
**License**: Apache-2.0
**Quality Score**: 9.5/10

### Why This Is Our Top Pick:

1. **Complete Integration**: Demonstrates full Vault + Nomad + Consul + Ansible stack
2. **Production Patterns**: Real-world configuration with proper security policies
3. **Automated Bootstrap**: Complete automation from infrastructure to application deployment
4. **Security-First**: Proper workload identity implementation and policy management
5. **Well-Documented**: Clear examples with extensive configuration coverage

### Key Implementation Highlights:

```yaml
# From their Ansible automation
- name: "write nomad-server policy to vault"
  command: vault policy write nomad-server /etc/ansible/templates/conf/nomad/policies/nomad_server_policy.hcl
  environment:
    VAULT_TOKEN: "{{ lookup('env', 'vault_master_token') }}"

- name: "create token for nomad-cluster role"
  shell: vault token create -policy nomad-server -period 172h -orphan -format=json | jq -r '.auth.client_token'
  register: nomad_server_token
```

## Recommended Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Ansible)

1. **Use livioribeiro/nomad-lxd-ansible pattern** for role organization:

   ```yaml
   - name: Setup Vault servers
     hosts: vault_servers
     roles:
       - ca_cert
       - hashicorp_apt
       - vault_server

   - name: Initialize Vault
     hosts: vault-server-1
     roles:
       - vault_server_init
   ```

2. **Implement integrated storage (Raft)** for simplicity:
   ```hcl
   storage "raft" {
     path = "/opt/vault/data"
     node_id = "{{ ansible_hostname }}"
     retry_join {
       leader_api_addr = "http://vault-0.service.consul:8200"
     }
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Nomad Integration (Modern Workload Identity)

Based on official HashiCorp documentation, implement workload identity pattern:

```hcl
# Nomad Agent Configuration
vault {
  enabled = true
  address = "http://vault.service.consul:8200"
  jwt_auth_backend_path = "nomad"
}

# Job Specification
vault {
  role = "nomad-restricted"
  change_mode = "restart"
}
```

### Phase 3: Security Hardening

1. **Auto-unseal with cloud KMS** (AWS/Azure/GCP)
2. **Policy templating** for dynamic access control
3. **TLS everywhere** with automated certificate management
4. **Comprehensive monitoring** and audit logging

## Tool Combination Insights

### Most Effective Tool Combinations:

1. **DeepWiki + Grep Search**: DeepWiki provided official documentation understanding, while grep found real implementation examples
2. **Perplexity Research + Official Docs**: Perplexity gave current best practices context, official docs provided technical details
3. **Multiple Grep Searches**: Different search patterns revealed complementary implementation approaches

### Tool Performance Analysis:

| Tool                | Strength                | Best Use Case                       | Limitation                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| DeepWiki            | Authoritative docs      | Understanding official capabilities | Limited to well-documented repos          |
| Grep Search         | Real-world examples     | Finding implementation patterns     | Requires knowing specific syntax          |
| Docker-MCP          | Web research capability | Current trends and practices        | Limited success in evaluation environment |
| Perplexity Research | Comprehensive analysis  | Getting current best practices      | Requires good prompting                   |

## Platform-Specific Observations: Cursor Performance

### Strengths Observed:

- **Excellent parallel tool execution**: Cursor handled multiple simultaneous MCP calls efficiently
- **Context management**: Maintained awareness of previous research during synthesis
- **File management**: Seamless creation and organization of research documentation
- **Progressive documentation**: Supported both progressive and comprehensive documentation approaches

### Unique Capabilities Demonstrated:

- **Multi-tool synthesis**: Successfully combined insights from 4 different MCP servers
- **Code pattern recognition**: Identified and synthesized common patterns across repositories
- **Quality assessment**: Effective evaluation of repository quality and applicability

### Areas for Improvement:

- **Docker-MCP integration**: Had challenges with Docker Hub fetching in evaluation environment
- **Environment setup**: Some MCP tools require better environment configuration

## Production Deployment Recommendations

### 1. Start with the Skatteetaten Pattern

- Use their Ansible structure as a foundation
- Adapt their policy management approach
- Leverage their bootstrap automation

### 2. Implement Modern Security Patterns

- Workload identity over static tokens
- Integrated storage over external dependencies
- Auto-unseal for operational simplicity

### 3. Layer in Additional Examples

- Use livioribeiro roles for clean organization
- Adopt ricsanfre patterns for Pi cluster deployments
- Reference official HashiCorp guides for production hardening

### 4. Monitoring and Operations

- Implement comprehensive logging from day one
- Set up automated backup and disaster recovery
- Plan for certificate rotation and secret management

## Conclusion

The research demonstrates that deploying Vault in Nomad clusters via Ansible is a mature, well-supported pattern with multiple production-ready examples available. The combination of HashiCorp's official tooling, community Ansible roles, and real-world implementations provides a solid foundation for enterprise deployments.

The **Skatteetaten/vagrant-hashistack** repository stands out as the most comprehensive example, providing a complete reference implementation that organizations can adapt for their specific needs. Combined with the modern workload identity features and automated deployment patterns identified through this research, organizations have clear path to production-ready Vault+Nomad+Ansible deployments.

### Next Steps for Implementation:

1. Clone and study the Skatteetaten repository structure
2. Adapt their Ansible roles for your infrastructure
3. Implement workload identity authentication patterns
4. Add monitoring, backup, and operational procedures
5. Test in development environments before production deployment
