# Synthesis of Vault + Ansible + Nomad Deployment Research

This document synthesizes findings on deploying HashiCorp Vault using Ansible to Nomad clusters, focusing on actionable deployments, best practices, and integration strategies.

## Best Example Repository

The **wescale.hashistack** repository provides a comprehensive example for deploying HashiCorp stacks, including Vault, using Ansible roles tailored for production use. It exemplifies best practices in automation and security and can serve as a reference for reliable implementations.

## Detailed Deployment Strategy

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Preparation**

   - Set up your infrastructure as described in the open-source homelab examples.
   - Utilize the `wescale.hashistack` repository for consistent Ansible roles.

2. **Ansible Configuration**

   - Define clear inventory and group variables for your infrastructure.
   - Leverage sophisticated playbooks for automatic setup.

3. **Deploy Components**

   - Use the Ansible playbook to install and configure Vault, Nomad, Consul, and other necessary components.
   - Ensure integration with Cloudflared and Caddy for security.

4. **Service Management**

   - Use Nomad job files for deploying applications.
   - Use Vault for secrets management and integrate it using Consul-Template.

5. **Security Implementation**

   - Implement best practices for Vault security, like TLS and secure tunneling with Cloudflared.
   - Secure all endpoints and use ACLs for compartmentalization.

6. **Testing and Monitoring**

   - Test deployments in isolated environments before production.
   - Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and alerting.

7. **Maintenance**
   - Automate updates and use tags to selectively update components.
   - Regularly check Vault's status and renew tokens using Nomad's vault integration.

## Tool Combination Insights

- **Phase 1** revealed the necessity of exploring different MCP servers for a thorough understanding.
- **Phase 2** emphasized creative synthesis by linking disparate tool findings and filling gaps through direct inquiries and fetch tools.

## Platform-Specific Observations

- Using resourceful approaches such as local Docker Compose or VMs can suit smaller setups.
- Larger setups benefit from native cloud solutions with Terraform and robust Ansible roles.

## Conclusion

By combining systematic research with creative problem-solving, numerous insights into deploying and maintaining a Vault + Ansible + Nomad stack were discovered. This provides both foundational knowledge and specifics to implement and secure such infrastructures.
