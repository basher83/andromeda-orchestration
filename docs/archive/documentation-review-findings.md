## Detailed Findings (Updated)

### âœ… RESOLVED Issues

2. **Secrets Management Documentation**:

   - `1password-integration.md` - Moved to archive with deprecation notice âœ…
   - `consul-1password-setup.md` - Moved to archive with deprecation notice âœ…
   - `infisical-setup-and-migration.md` - Remains as current documentation âœ…
   - `docs/archive/1password-connect-troubleshooting.md` - Created for legacy reference âœ…

3. **NetBox Documentation**:

   - `netbox.md` moved from archive to main docs (highly relevant content) âœ…

4. **Troubleshooting Guide**:
   - Updated to focus on general issues and Infisical âœ…
   - 1Password-specific content moved to archive âœ…

### All Issues Now Resolved

1. **Inventory File References**:
   - `troubleshooting.md` - All references updated to `infisical.proxmox.yml` âœ…
   - `uv-ansible-notes.md` - Already correct âœ…
   - No more legacy inventory references found âœ…

2. **Project Task List**:

   - All tasks checked off âœ…
   - consul-assessment.yml successfully migrated âœ…

3. **Playbook Migration**:
   - `consul-assessment.yml` now uses Infisical with:
     - Proper authentication pattern matching inventory files
     - Cluster-aware token selection (DOGGOS vs OG)
     - Clear documentation and prerequisites

## Recommendations

### Optional Enhancements

1. **Archive Organization** (Nice to have):
   - Consider adding a README to the archive directory explaining the subdirectory structure
   - Document why certain files are in subdirectories vs root archive
   - This is purely organizational, not affecting functionality

2. **Secrets Organization in Infisical**:
   - Current flat structure at `/apollo-13/` works but could be better organized
   - Consider future migration to structured paths like:
     - `/clusters/doggos-homelab/`
     - `/clusters/og-homelab/`
     - `/services/consul/`
     - `/services/nomad/`

### Documentation Best Practices (Already Implemented)

1. âœ… **Migration Markers**: Consistent deprecation notices used
2. âœ… **Command Format**: Standardized on `uv run ansible-*` format
3. âœ… **Cross-References**: Most docs now point to current practices
4. âœ… **Archive Strategy**: Proper archival of outdated documentation

## Positive Findings

1. **Quick Response**: All major issues were addressed immediately
2. **Good Judgment**: Moving netbox.md out of archive was the right call
3. **Clear Migration Path**: Documentation clearly shows 1Password â†’ Infisical transition
