## Archive Policy

### When to Archive

Documents should be moved here when:

1. They describe deprecated functionality
2. They document completed one-time efforts
3. They contain outdated patterns that could confuse developers
4. They represent historical milestones

### When NOT to Archive

Do not archive:

1. Documentation that is still partially relevant
2. Files frequently referenced for context
3. Documentation that just needs updating

### Consider Deletion

After archiving, evaluate if content should be permanently removed to reduce repository size and confusion.

## Note

Files in this archive are preserved for historical reference only and should **not** be used in current implementations. Always refer to current documentation in `/docs/` for active development.
