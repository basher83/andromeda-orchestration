# Date Correction Note - Domain Migration Documentation

## Issue Identified

On August 20, 2025, a date confusion issue was discovered in the project management documentation. Several documents incorrectly showed January 2025 dates for work that was actually completed in August 2025.

## Root Cause

The domain migration was initially planned for January 19-24, 2025, and planning documents were created at that time. However, the actual implementation was deferred and completed on August 19-20, 2025. When the work was completed, the documentation was incorrectly updated using the original January planning dates instead of the actual August implementation dates.

## Corrections Made (August 20, 2025)

### 1. Renamed and Updated Completed Tasks File

- **Original**: `/docs/project-management/completed/2025-01.md` (incorrectly dated)
- **Corrected**: `/docs/project-management/completed/2025-08.md`
- **Changes**: Updated all date references from January to August 2025

### 2. Archived January Planning Document

- **Original Location**: `/docs/project-management/sprints/2025-01-19-domain-migration.md`
- **New Location**: `/docs/project-management/archive/domain-migration/2025-01-19-domain-migration-planning.md`
- **Added Note**: Clarified this was a planning document that was never executed

### 3. Updated Current Sprint Tracking

- **File**: `/docs/project-management/current-sprint.md`
- **Changes**: Updated all date references from January 20-24 to August 20-24, 2025

### 4. Fixed Task Summary

- **File**: `/docs/project-management/task-summary.md`
- **Changes**: Updated domain migration section dates from January to August 2025

## Verified Implementation Dates

Based on git history, the actual implementation dates were:

- **PR #71** (homelab_domain variable): Merged August 19, 2025 (commit 5ecac8d)
- **PR #72** (Nomad HCL2 variables): Merged August 19, 2025 (commit 260486a)
- **PR #76** (NetBox DNS playbooks): Merged August 19, 2025 (commit 9567b22)
- **PR #73** (markdownlint update): Merged August 19, 2025 (commit 5cabdf2)
- **PR #74** (Python update): Merged August 19, 2025 (commit 4ed8be4)

## Lessons Learned

1. Always verify dates against git history when updating documentation
2. Clearly distinguish between planning documents and implementation records
3. Archive planning documents that aren't executed to avoid confusion
4. Use git commit dates as the source of truth for implementation timelines

## Current Status (August 20, 2025)

- Domain migration Sprints 1-2 are complete (Foundation and NetBox DNS)
- Sprint 3 (PowerDNS Integration) is scheduled to start today
- Remaining sprints (4-5) are scheduled for August 21-24, 2025
- All documentation now correctly reflects August 2025 dates
