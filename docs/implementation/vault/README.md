## üöÄ Quick Start

### Development Deployment

```bash
# Deploy Vault in dev mode for exploration
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/infrastructure/vault/deploy-vault-dev.yml \
  -i inventory/doggos-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy Vault with Raft storage
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/infrastructure/vault/deploy-vault-prod.yml \
  -i inventory/doggos-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml
```

## üìã Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed

- Ansible role structure
- Dev mode configuration
- Production Raft configuration
- Nomad JWT integration templates
- Consul service registration
- Comprehensive documentation

### üöß In Progress

- Testing in homelab environment
- PKI hierarchy setup

### ‚è≥ Planned

- Master Vault deployment
- Automated secret rotation
- Snapshot automation
- Production deployment

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Storage Backends

- **Development**: In-memory (ephemeral)
- **Production**: Raft (integrated, no external dependencies)
- **Alternative**: Consul (for large-scale deployments)

### Integration Points

- **Nomad**: JWT workload identity for dynamic secrets
- **Consul**: Service registration and health checks
- **Infisical**: Secure storage of unseal keys and root tokens

### Security Layers

1. **Auto-unseal**: Transit, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault options
2. **Audit Logging**: File and syslog backends
3. **Policy Framework**: Three-tier (admin/producer/consumer)
4. **Certificate Management**: Automated renewal via PKI

### Playbooks

- `playbooks/infrastructure/vault/deploy-vault-dev.yml`
- `playbooks/infrastructure/vault/deploy-vault-prod.yml`

### Role

- `roles/vault/` - Complete Ansible role with tasks, templates, handlers

### Configuration

- `roles/vault/defaults/main.yml` - Default variables
- `roles/vault/templates/` - Configuration templates

## üîë Key Decisions

### Why Raft Storage?

- No external dependencies (vs Consul backend)
- Integrated snapshots and backup
- Suitable for 3-5 node clusters
- Simpler disaster recovery

### Why Support Dev Mode?

- Safe exploration environment
- Learning and testing features
- Clear migration path to production
- No unsealing required during development

### Why Optional TLS?

- Flexibility for internal homelab networks
- Simplified initial deployment
- Can enable for production/external access
- Clear security documentation

## üìä Deployment Phases

| Phase | Focus | Duration | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| 0 | Infrastructure Assessment | 1 day | ‚è≥ Planned |
| 1 | Dev Mode Exploration | 1 week | ‚è≥ Planned |
| 2 | PKI Infrastructure | 1 week | ‚è≥ Planned |
| 3 | Production Deployment | 1 week | ‚è≥ Planned |
| 4 | Secret Rotation | 1 week | ‚è≥ Planned |
| 5 | Disaster Recovery | 1 week | ‚è≥ Planned |
| 6 | Full Integration | 1 week | ‚è≥ Planned |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Vault is sealed**: Check auto-unseal configuration or manually unseal
- **Cannot connect**: Verify network, firewall rules, and service status
- **Permission denied**: Ensure mlock capability is set on binary

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check Vault status
export VAULT_ADDR='http://vault:8200'
vault status

# Unseal Vault (if not using auto-unseal)
vault operator unseal <key>

# View audit logs
tail -f /var/log/vault/audit.log | jq
```
