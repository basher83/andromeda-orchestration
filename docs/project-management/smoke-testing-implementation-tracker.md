## Implementation Checklist

### For Each Component

When implementing smoke tests for a new component:

- [ ] Create `playbooks/infrastructure/<component>/smoke-test.yml`
- [ ] Include minimum 10 test categories
- [ ] Follow Vault implementation pattern
- [ ] Add mise task to `.mise.toml`
- [ ] Update component README
- [ ] Test in development environment
- [ ] Test in staging environment
- [ ] Update this tracker
- [ ] Update operations guide
- [ ] Create component-specific troubleshooting section

### Standard Test Structure

All smoke tests must include:

1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Network connectivity
   - SSH access
   - Service status

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Token/credential validity
   - Required permissions
   - Secret availability

3. **Operational Readiness**
   - API accessibility
   - Write/read operations
   - Port availability
   - Resource checks

4. **Dependencies**
   - Related services
   - Infrastructure requirements
   - Version compatibility

5. **Summary**
   - Pass/fail count
   - Actionable next steps
   - Clear status indication

## Success Metrics

### Per Component

- ✅ All test categories pass in development
- ✅ All test categories pass in staging
- ✅ Execution time < 60 seconds
- ✅ Clear error messages with remediation steps
- ✅ No false positives in 30 days

### Overall Project

- 📊 100% of critical components have smoke tests
- 📊 All smoke tests integrated with CI/CD
- 📊 < 5% false positive rate
- 📊 Average execution time < 45 seconds
- 📊 100% documentation coverage

## Timeline

- Week 1: Documentation framework
- Week 1: Standards establishment

### Phase 2: Core Services (🚧 Current)

- Week 2: Consul implementation
- Week 2: Nomad implementation
- Week 3: DNS/IPAM implementation

### Phase 3: Infrastructure (📋 Planned)

- Week 3: Proxmox implementation
- Week 4: Traefik implementation
- Week 4: Integration testing

### Phase 4: Automation (📋 Planned)

- Week 5: CI/CD integration
- Week 5: Monitoring integration
- Week 6: Performance optimization

## Notes

### Lessons Learned from Vault Implementation

1. **Test actual operations, not simulations** - Check mode is not sufficient
2. **Provide actionable feedback** - Each failure needs specific remediation steps
3. **Handle secrets appropriately** - Different treatment for operational vs recovery secrets
4. **Make execution simple** - Mise tasks are essential for adoption
5. **Document thoroughly** - Both usage and troubleshooting

### Best Practices Established

- Use visual indicators (✅/❌/⚠️) for clarity
- Number tests sequentially for easy reference
- Group related tests together
- Always include a comprehensive summary
- Support verbose output for debugging
- Allow selective test execution via tags
