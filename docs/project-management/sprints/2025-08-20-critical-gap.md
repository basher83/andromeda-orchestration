# CRITICAL GAP: Infrastructure Configuration Not Applied

**Date Discovered**: August 20, 2025
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocks all further work
**Impact**: Domain migration timeline at risk

---

## Summary

A critical gap has been discovered in the domain migration process. While PRs #71, #72, and #76 have been successfully merged, updating the repository code to use the new `homelab_domain` variable (spaceships.work), these changes have NOT been applied to the actual running infrastructure.

## Current State

### Repository (Git)

- ✅ PR #71: Added homelab_domain variable to group_vars
- ✅ PR #72: Updated Nomad jobs to use HCL2 variables
- ✅ PR #76: Migrated NetBox DNS playbooks to use domain variables
- ✅ All code in repository uses new domain structure

### Running Infrastructure

- ❌ Consul: Still configured with old domains
- ❌ Nomad: Running with old configuration
- ❌ Traefik: Using old domain in routes
- ❌ All services: Registered with old domain names
- ❌ PostgreSQL: Not deployed (PowerDNS dependency)
- ❌ PowerDNS: Cannot be deployed until above is fixed

## Impact Analysis

### Immediate Impact

1. Cannot proceed with PowerDNS deployment
2. Cannot sync DNS zones with new domain
3. Cannot complete domain migration as planned
4. macOS developers remain blocked (mDNS conflict)

### Timeline Impact

- Original estimate: 3 hours for today's work
- Revised estimate: 5.5+ hours
- Risk of spillover into tomorrow's sprint
- Potential delay of entire migration by 1-2 days

## Root Cause

The deployment process was not clearly defined in the original plan. The assumption was that merging PRs would automatically update the infrastructure, but this requires explicit Ansible playbook runs to apply the configuration changes.

## Corrective Actions

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Step 0: Apply Infrastructure Configuration** (1.5 hours)
   - Run site.yml playbook to apply group_vars
   - Restart Consul and Nomad services
   - Re-deploy Nomad jobs with new variables

2. **Step 0.5: Deploy PostgreSQL** (45 minutes)
   - Create and deploy PostgreSQL Nomad job
   - Verify database accessibility
   - Create PowerDNS database schema

3. **Then proceed with original plan**
   - Deploy PowerDNS
   - Configure backend
   - Sync zones

### Process Improvements

1. **Update deployment checklist**
   - Add "Apply to infrastructure" step after PR merge
   - Include verification steps
   - Document rollback procedures

2. **Enhance documentation**
   - Create clear deployment runbook
   - Add infrastructure state verification steps
   - Include troubleshooting guide

3. **Improve sprint planning**
   - Account for infrastructure application time
   - Add explicit deployment tasks
   - Include verification milestones

## Lessons Learned

1. **Assumption Risk**: Never assume code changes are automatically applied
2. **Verification Gap**: Need better infrastructure state verification
3. **Documentation Need**: Deployment processes must be explicitly documented
4. **Planning Gap**: Sprint plans must include infrastructure application steps

## Resolution Timeline

- **08:00**: Gap discovered during PowerDNS deployment attempt
- **08:30**: Root cause identified
- **09:00**: Action plan updated with corrective steps
- **09:30**: Begin infrastructure configuration application
- **11:00**: Target: Infrastructure updated with new configuration
- **12:00**: Target: PostgreSQL deployed
- **14:00**: Target: PowerDNS deployed and operational

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All hosts have new group_vars applied
- [ ] Consul services show spaceships.work domain
- [ ] Nomad jobs have homelab_domain variable set
- [ ] Traefik routes use new domain
- [ ] PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- [ ] PowerDNS can connect to PostgreSQL
- [ ] DNS queries resolve for spaceships.work

## Communication

This critical gap has been communicated through:

- Updated sprint documentation
- Revised action plan with clear prerequisites
- Task summary updated with blocked status
- This dedicated alert document
