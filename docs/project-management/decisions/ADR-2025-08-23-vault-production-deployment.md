## Status

Accepted (Phase 2 Complete)

## Context

Vault was running in development mode across the infrastructure, which caused critical limitations:

- **No persistence**: All secrets lost on restart (inmem storage)
- **No production features**: Auto-unsealing, audit logging, HA disabled
- **Blocking production services**: PostgreSQL, PowerDNS, and other services couldn't store credentials persistently
- **Security concerns**: Dev mode uses fixed tokens, no unsealing, HTTP only

This was identified as the root blocker preventing:

- Domain migration completion (.local ‚Üí spaceships.work)
- PowerDNS deployment with PostgreSQL backend
- Production service deployments
- Proper secret management across the infrastructure

## Decision

Deploy Vault in production mode with:

### Storage Backend: Raft

- Integrated storage (no external dependencies like Consul)
- Built-in snapshots and backup
- Suitable for 3-5 node clusters
- Simpler disaster recovery than Consul backend

### Deployment Architecture

```plain
3-Node Raft Cluster:
- nomad-server-1-lloyd (192.168.10.11) - Leader
- nomad-server-2-holly (192.168.10.12) - Follower
- nomad-server-3-mable (192.168.10.13) - Follower

Storage: /opt/vault/data (persistent)
Ports: 8200 (API), 8201 (Cluster)
Version: 1.20.2 (standardized)
```

### Security Configuration

- **Initial Phase**: Manual unseal with 5 keys (3 of 5 threshold)
- **Audit Logging**: File backend at `/var/log/vault/audit.log`
- **TLS**: Disabled initially, enable in Phase 3
- **Policies**: PostgreSQL and PowerDNS service policies
- **Secret Storage**: Root token and unseal keys in Infisical

### Integration Points

- **Secrets Engines**: Database (PostgreSQL), KV v2 (application secrets)
- **Auth Methods**: Token (initial), JWT for Nomad workloads (planned)
- **Service Policies**: postgresql-service, powerdns-service

## Consequences

### Positive

- Persistent secret storage across restarts
- Production-ready security features
- Unblocks all downstream services
- Enables dynamic database credentials
- Audit trail for compliance
- HA with automatic failover

### Negative

- Manual unsealing required after restart (until auto-unseal configured)
- Operational complexity vs dev mode
- Backup procedures needed
- Monitoring requirements increased

### Risks

- Unseal key management (mitigated by Infisical storage)
- Raft consensus issues (mitigated by 3-node cluster)
- Storage corruption (mitigated by daily snapshots)
- Network partitions (mitigated by dual-NIC configuration)

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Continue with Dev Mode

- Pros: Simple, no unsealing required
- Rejected: Blocks all production deployments, no persistence

### Alternative 2: Consul Storage Backend

- Pros: External storage, leverages existing Consul cluster
- Rejected: Additional dependency, complex troubleshooting

### Alternative 3: Dedicated Vault Cluster VMs

- Pros: Complete isolation, easier scaling
- Rejected: Resource overhead, complexity for current scale

### Alternative 4: PostgreSQL Storage Backend

- Pros: Familiar database, easy backups
- Rejected: HA complexity, performance concerns

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Production Deployment ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ Pre-deployment assessment (all prerequisites met)
2. ‚úÖ Stop dev mode services
3. ‚úÖ Deploy production configuration with Ansible
4. ‚úÖ Initialize cluster (lloyd as first node)
5. ‚úÖ Secure initialization data in Infisical
6. ‚úÖ Unseal all three nodes
7. ‚úÖ Verify Raft cluster formation

### Phase 2: Configuration ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ Enable audit logging
2. ‚úÖ Create service policies (PostgreSQL, PowerDNS)
3. ‚úÖ Enable secret engines (database, kv-v2)
4. ‚úÖ Configure for 24.3GB storage capacity

### Phase 3: Service Integration üöß

1. ‚è≥ Configure PostgreSQL database backend
2. ‚è≥ Set up Nomad JWT authentication
3. ‚è≥ Store PowerDNS secrets
4. ‚è≥ Enable auto-unseal (Transit or Cloud KMS)

### Phase 4: Operational Readiness ‚è≥

1. ‚è≥ Configure automated snapshots
2. ‚è≥ Integrate with monitoring (Netdata)
3. ‚è≥ Document runbooks
4. ‚è≥ Test disaster recovery

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ 3-node cluster operational with Raft consensus
- ‚úÖ Audit logging active
- ‚úÖ Secret engines enabled
- ‚úÖ Service policies created
- ‚è≥ PostgreSQL credentials generated dynamically
- ‚è≥ PowerDNS retrieving secrets
- ‚è≥ Automated backups running

## Migration Path

From dev mode to production:

```bash
# Stop dev mode
systemctl stop vault-dev

# Deploy production
ansible-playbook playbooks/infrastructure/vault/deploy-vault-prod.yml

# Initialize (one time)
vault operator init

# Unseal (after any restart)
vault operator unseal <key-1>
vault operator unseal <key-2>
vault operator unseal <key-3>
```

## Infrastructure Repository

The actual Vault cluster infrastructure (VMs, networking, storage) is managed via Terraform in a separate repository:

### [Hercules-Vault-Infra](https://github.com/basher83/Hercules-Vault-Infra)

- **Purpose**: Terraform code for provisioning the dedicated 4-VM Vault cluster
- **Backend**: Scalr remote state management
- **Workspace**: `production-vault`
- **Provider**: Proxmox (bpg/proxmox v0.78+)

### Architecture Details

```plain
Network: 192.168.10.30-33
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vault-master (192.168.10.30) - Transit auto-unseal provider
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 40GB SSD on node: lloyd
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vault-prod-1 (192.168.10.31) - Production Raft node
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB SSD on node: holly
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vault-prod-2 (192.168.10.32) - Production Raft node
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB SSD on node: mable
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vault-prod-3 (192.168.10.33) - Production Raft node
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB SSD on node: lloyd
```

### Deployment Flow

1. **Terraform (Hercules-Vault-Infra)**: Provisions VMs with cloud-init
2. **Cloud-init**: Installs Vault binary and QEMU guest agent
3. **Ansible (andromeda-orchestration)**: Configures and manages Vault cluster

### Key Features

- Automated VM provisioning via cloud-init
- HA distribution across Proxmox nodes
- Ubuntu 22.04 template (ID: 8000)
- Total resources: 14 vCPUs, 28GB RAM, 340GB storage
