- API service: Dynamic port (accessible via Traefik at <https://powerdns.lab.local>)
- MySQL with persistent storage at /opt/nomad/volumes/powerdns-mysql
- Docker image: powerdns/pdns-auth-48:latest
- Updated to use dynamic port allocation for API (removed static 8081)

### 12. Integrate Nomad Job Management

**Description**: Organize Nomad jobs and implement standardized deployment patterns
**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-08-02)
**Blockers**: None
**Related**: Infrastructure management patterns

Tasks:

- [x] Create nomad-jobs/ directory structure (core-infrastructure, platform-services, applications)
- [x] Migrate PowerDNS job to new structure with dynamic port allocation
- [x] Create Traefik load balancer job specification
- [x] Update deployment playbooks to use community.general.nomad_job Galaxy module
- [x] Create specialized deployment playbook for Traefik with validation
- [x] Document port allocation strategy (dynamic by default, static for DNS/LB only)
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with Nomad job patterns

**Implementation Details**:

- Using Galaxy modules instead of custom modules for maintainability
- Traefik will own ports 80/443 for all HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- All other services use dynamic ports (20000-32000) with Consul service discovery
- PowerDNS API now accessible via <https://powerdns.lab.local> through Traefik

### 13. Deploy Traefik Load Balancer

**Description**: Deploy Traefik as the primary load balancer for all services
**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-08-02)
**Blockers**: None
**Related**: Network architecture and service routing

Tasks:

- [x] Fixed Docker iptables/nftables compatibility on all nodes
- [x] Fixed Consul configuration blocks on Nomad servers and clients
- [x] Enabled ACLs on all Consul agents with proper tokens
- [x] Created Consul auth method for Nomad workloads
- [x] Deployed Traefik with service registration in Consul
- [x] Services registered: traefik, traefik-http, traefik-https
- [x] Verify ports 80/443 are available and bound
- [x] Confirm Consul Catalog integration working

**Implementation Details**:

- Running on nomad-client-1-lloyd (allocation: aa69be4a)
- HTTP: 192.168.11.20:80
- HTTPS: 192.168.11.20:443
- Admin: Dynamic port with Consul service registration
- All services properly registered in Consul with health checks

### 14. Optimize Netdata Monitoring Infrastructure

**Description**: Analyze and optimize Netdata configuration across all nodes
**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-08-04)
**Blockers**: None
**Related**: Infrastructure monitoring and observability

Tasks:

- [x] Collected comprehensive Netdata configurations from all nodes
- [x] Analyzed streaming architecture and confirmed parent/child relationships
- [x] Verified Consul integration - all health checks passing
- [x] Identified and fixed statsd port misconfigurations
- [x] Disabled unused Statsd collectors on all nodes to save resources
- [x] Documented configuration findings and recommendations

**Key Findings**:

- Netdata streaming working correctly (issues were resolved 2025-08-02)
- Parent nodes: lloyd, holly, mable, pve1 (correctly configured)
- 192.168.11.x network used for dedicated Netdata streaming
- No Consul errors, all netdata-child health checks passing
- Statsd was enabled but completely unused - disabled on all nodes

## Infrastructure Fixes and Improvements

### Service Identity Investigation

**Status**: ✅ Investigation Complete (2025-08-02)
**Related**: Consul-Nomad service mesh integration

- Investigated service identity token derivation issue using Netdata monitoring
- Confirmed Consul auth method `nomad-workloads` is properly configured:
  - JWKS endpoint accessible from all nodes
  - Binding rules and roles correctly set up
  - Policies grant appropriate KV read access
- Root cause identified: Nomad not attempting to derive workload tokens
- Applied workaround: Deployed PowerDNS without service blocks
- Current deployment status:
  - Traefik: Running with service blocks (working somehow)
  - PowerDNS: Running without service blocks (workaround)
- Updated troubleshooting documentation with investigation findings

### Infrastructure Issues Resolved

**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-08-02)

Multiple infrastructure issues fixed to enable service mesh:

- Docker iptables/nftables compatibility resolved on all nodes
- Consul ACL configuration fixed on all agents
- Multiple Consul configuration blocks cleaned up
- Created auth method and policies for Nomad workload identities

### 19. NetBox Deployment (External)
