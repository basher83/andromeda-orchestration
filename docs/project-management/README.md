# Project Management Documentation

This directory contains project tracking, task management, and infrastructure inventory documentation.

## Documents

### üìã [task-list.md](task-list.md)
Comprehensive project task tracking:
- Phase-based task organization
- Implementation checklists
- Progress tracking
- Dependencies and blockers
- Success criteria

### üèóÔ∏è [imported-infrastructure.md](imported-infrastructure.md)
Documentation of infrastructure components imported from other projects:
- Imported Ansible roles
- Custom modules
- Integration patterns
- Source repositories
- Modification history

## Purpose

These documents help track:
- **Project Progress** - What's done, in progress, and planned
- **Dependencies** - What needs to be completed before other tasks
- **Infrastructure State** - What components exist and their origins
- **Decision History** - Why certain approaches were chosen

## Task Organization

Tasks are organized by:
1. **Implementation Phases** (0-5)
2. **Priority** (High/Medium/Low)
3. **Component** (Consul, PowerDNS, NetBox, etc.)
4. **Status** (Complete/In Progress/Planned/Blocked)

## Current Focus

- **Active Phase**: Phase 1 - Consul DNS Foundation
- **Next Phase**: Phase 3 - NetBox Integration
- **Recently Completed**: Phase 2 - PowerDNS Deployment

## Using These Documents

### For Project Planning
1. Review `task-list.md` for current status
2. Identify dependencies and blockers
3. Plan next sprint based on priorities

### For Implementation
1. Check task details and acceptance criteria
2. Review imported components in `imported-infrastructure.md`
3. Update task status as work progresses
