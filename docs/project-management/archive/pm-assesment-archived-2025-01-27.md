# Project Management Assessment (Comprehensive review of `docs/project-management/`)

Date: 2025-08-10

## Methodology (per project-orchestrator)

1. Assess Current Context
   - Reviewed `docs/project-management/current-sprint.md` and `task-summary.md`
   - Scanned phase docs under `docs/project-management/phases/`
   - Cross-checked navigation and history: `README.md`, `completed/`, `archive/`, `task-list.md`
2. Identify Required Actions
   - Alignment fixes, status clarity, and next-step checklists
3. Execute Task Management Ops
   - Propose concise, file-specific edits and an immediate “Run Next” guide
4. Manage Sprint Workflow / Phase Management / Reporting
   - Summarize active work, blockers, metrics, and recommendations

---

## TL;DR

- PowerDNS is standardized on Mode A (PostgreSQL backend) with Vault dynamic credentials; prototype docs marked accordingly.
- Phase labeling is consistent (Phase 5 = Multi-Site). Path drift and `.testing` references are resolved.
- Phase 4 “Next Phase” wording corrected and task list Active Tasks updated; remaining cleanup is optional PM banner + keep the “Run Next” checklist in Phase 4.
- Nomad service identity token derivation is resolved; workloads derive tokens when identity blocks with `aud=["consul.io"]` are present.

---

## Current Sprint Status (from `current-sprint.md`)

- Active:
  - PowerDNS Mode A Adoption (Phase 4): PostgreSQL deployed, Vault DB secrets configured; next step is PDNS job + NetBox sync
  - Testing & QA Initiative (planning kickoff)
- Blocked:
  - None
- Recently Completed (last 7 days): NetBox bootstrap, Netdata optimization, Traefik, Vault dev-mode, Mode A baseline

---

## Key Metrics (from `task-summary.md`)

- Total tasks: 36; Completed: 17 (47%); In Progress: 1; Blocked: 1; Not Started: 17
- Phase status snapshot:
  - Phase 3: In Progress (40%)
  - Phase 4: In Progress (15%)
  - Phase 5: Future
  - Phase 6: Future

---

## Phase Alignment and Navigation

- Phases index is consistent:
  - Phase 3: NetBox Integration and DNS Migration
  - Phase 4: PowerDNS-NetBox Integration
  - Phase 5: Multi-Site Expansion and Optimization
  - Phase 6: Post-Implementation and Continuous Improvement
- Navigation links in `README.md`, phases `README.md`, and phase files are coherent post-fixes.

---

## Findings (directory-wide)

Resolved (no action needed):

- Path drift (`jobs/` vs `nomad-jobs/`), missing `consul/` in playbook paths, and stray `.testing` references
- Multi-Site labeling (Phase 5)
- Mixed completion vs rollback (prototype vs Mode A now clearly delineated)
- Ops status deltas (SQLite prototype doc now marked outdated; operational SoT is Mode A)

Minor improvements to consider:

- Add a small banner in PM docs noting the PowerDNS baseline: “Mode A with PostgreSQL + Vault dynamic credentials.”
- Keep the compact “Run This Next” checklist in Phase 4 (see below) to streamline execution.

---

## Applied edits

- Phase 4 doc: “Next Phase” now says “Phase 5 (Multi-Site Expansion and Optimization)”.
- Task list: “Active Tasks” updated to “2 (PowerDNS Mode A Adoption, Testing & QA Initiative)”.

## Remaining minor recommendation

- PM banner (optional, small callout) in PM overview files: “PowerDNS baseline: Mode A (PostgreSQL) with Vault dynamic credentials; prototype MariaDB/SQLite references are historical.”

---

## Phase 4: “Run This Next” (concise checklist)

1. Verify DNS:53 and API via Traefik/dynamic port
2. Confirm Vault DB config (connection + `powerdns-role`)
3. Ensure PDNS job template uses Vault dynamic credentials
4. Execute NetBox → PowerDNS sync and validate forward/reverse lookups
5. Document runbook updates

---

## Risks and Blockers

- Resolved (Aug 10, 2025): Nomad workload service identity tokens derive correctly; ensure jobs include identity blocks with `aud=["consul.io"]`.
- Testing coverage gaps (custom modules, roles) — see Testing & QA Initiative.

---

## Recommendations (next 1–2 sprints)

- Implement the Phase 4 “Run This Next” and close out the PDNS Mode A adoption.
- Kick off Testing & QA Initiative tasks (unit tests and Molecule for HashiCorp/DNS roles).
- Refresh `task-list.md` metrics and remove lingering FIXMEs.
- Prepare Phase 5 planning doc sections that depend on Phase 4 outcomes (e.g., Multi-Site DNS strategy prerequisites).
