4. **Create backup scripts** for existing configurations

### Week 2-3 Focus

1. **Design IP addressing schema** based on assessment findings
2. **Set up development environment** for safe testing
3. **Create initial service templates** for Consul and PowerDNS
4. **Draft migration runbooks** for each phase

### Month 2 Goals
