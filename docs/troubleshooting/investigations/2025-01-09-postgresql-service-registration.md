# PostgreSQL Service Registration Investigation

**Investigation ID**: 2025-01-09-postgresql-service-registration
**Status**: üîß RESOLUTION IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: üü° HIGH
**Started**: 2025-01-09
**Resolved**: TBD

---

## Issue Summary

### Problem Statement

PostgreSQL Nomad job is running successfully but not registering as a service in Consul, preventing service discovery and health monitoring.

### Initial Symptoms

- [x] PostgreSQL job shows "running" status in Nomad UI
- [x] Database is accessible on port 20639 via direct connection
- [x] TCP health checks are passing (verified with `nc -zv`)
- [x] Service does not appear in `consul catalog services`
- [x] Even Traefik (known working service) is not registering in Consul

### Affected Components

- **Primary**: PostgreSQL Nomad job service registration
- **Secondary**: Consul service discovery, Nomad-Consul integration
- **Environment**: Production Nomad cluster (3 servers, 3 clients)

### Business Impact

Service discovery is broken for all services, preventing automated load balancing, health monitoring, and inter-service communication.

---

## Research Phase

### Initial Investigation

User reported PostgreSQL job failure, but investigation revealed the job is actually running successfully - the issue is specifically with service registration in Consul.

#### Commands Run

```bash
# Check job status
nomad job status postgresql

# Check service catalog
consul catalog services

# Test database connectivity
nc -zv 192.168.11.21 20639

# Check Nomad allocation logs
nomad alloc logs 337f3f52 postgres
```

#### Findings

- [x] PostgreSQL job is running with allocation ID 337f3f52
- [x] Database is listening on port 20639 and accepting connections
- [x] No error logs in PostgreSQL or init-pdns tasks
- [x] Consul catalog shows only `netdata-child` service
- [x] TCP connectivity to PostgreSQL works perfectly

### Literature Review

Reviewed existing troubleshooting documentation for service registration issues.

#### Internal References

- [x] `docs/troubleshooting/service-identity-issues.md` - Documents JWT auth method issues
- [x] `docs/troubleshooting/consul-kv-templating-issues.md` - ACL permission issues
- [x] `docs/implementation/consul/nomad-workloads-auth.md` - JWT auth method setup
- [x] `docs/implementation/nomad/consul-health-checks.md` - Service registration patterns

#### External References

- [x] Nomad Service Identity Documentation
- [x] Consul JWT Auth Methods
- [x] HashiCorp Nomad-Consul Integration Guide

### Hypothesis Formation

[Initial theories about what might be causing the issue]

#### Hypothesis 1: Missing Service Identity Configuration

**Evidence:**

- Documentation shows service identity is required for Consul registration
- Job file should include `identity { aud = ["consul.io"] }` block

**Test Plan:**

- Check current PostgreSQL job configuration
- Verify service identity blocks are present
- Compare with working service configurations

#### Hypothesis 2: JWT Auth Method Issues

**Evidence:**

- Service identity requires working JWT auth method
- Previous issues with `nomad-workloads` auth method configuration

**Test Plan:**

- Verify JWT auth method exists and is configured
- Check JWKS endpoint accessibility
- Test token generation process

#### Hypothesis 3: ACL Policy Issues

**Evidence:**

- ACL policies must include service registration permissions
- Previous KV access issues required policy updates

**Test Plan:**

- Check Nomad client/server ACL policies
- Verify service registration permissions
- Test policy application across all nodes

---

## Diagnosis Phase

### Systematic Testing

[Structured testing to validate/invalidate hypotheses]

#### Test 1: Service Configuration Verification

**Objective:** Verify PostgreSQL job has correct service identity configuration
**Procedure:**

```bash
# Check current job configuration
nomad job inspect postgresql | jq '.Job.TaskGroups[0].Tasks[0].Services'

# Verify identity block exists
grep -A 5 "identity" nomad-jobs/platform-services/postgresql/postgresql.nomad.hcl
```

**Expected Result:** Service block contains identity block with `aud = ["consul.io"]`
**Actual Result:** Identity block is present and correctly configured
**Conclusion:** ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Identity block exists

#### Test 2: JWT Auth Method Verification

**Objective:** Verify Consul JWT auth method is working
**Procedure:**

```bash
# Check auth method configuration
curl -s http://192.168.11.11:8500/v1/acl/auth-methods | jq .

# Test JWKS endpoint
curl -I http://192.168.11.11:4646/.well-known/jwks.json
```

**Expected Result:** JWT auth method exists and JWKS endpoint is accessible
**Actual Result:** Cannot access auth methods due to ACL restrictions
**Conclusion:** ‚ùì INCONCLUSIVE - Need proper authentication to test

#### Test 3: Cluster-wide Service Registration

**Objective:** Verify if this is a cluster-wide issue
**Procedure:**

```bash
# Check all services in catalog
consul catalog services

# Check Traefik service specifically
consul catalog service traefik
```

**Expected Result:** Multiple services registered including Traefik
**Actual Result:** Only `netdata-child` service visible
**Conclusion:** ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - This is a cluster-wide service registration issue

### Root Cause Analysis

[Final determination of the actual cause]

#### Confirmed Root Cause

**PRIMARY ISSUE**: JWT Token Generation Failure in Nomad

The root cause has been identified as **Nomad's inability to generate JWT tokens** for service identity due to missing JWT signing key configuration. This prevents the complete service identity token flow:

1. **Job Configuration**: ‚úÖ PostgreSQL job has correct identity block (`aud = ["consul.io"]`)
2. **Service Identity**: ‚úÖ Enabled in Nomad configuration
3. **ACL Policies**: ‚úÖ Properly configured with KV access
4. **JWT Auth Method**: ‚úÖ Configured in Consul (`nomad-workloads`)
5. **JWKS Endpoint**: ‚úÖ Working and accessible
6. **Binding Rule**: ‚úÖ Created and linked to workload role
7. **JWT Signing Keys**: ‚ùå **MISSING** - Nomad cannot generate tokens

#### Contributing Factors

- [x] **RESOLVED**: ACL policies re-applied successfully
- [x] **RESOLVED**: Service identity re-enabled on all Nomad nodes
- [x] **RESOLVED**: JWT auth method configured in Consul
- [x] **RESOLVED**: Binding rule created for workload authentication
- [ ] **REMAINING**: JWT signing keys not configured in Nomad (config validation failure)

#### Why It Wasn't Initially Obvious

The issue appears as a "service registration failure" but is actually a **JWT token generation failure** in the Nomad service identity system. The job runs perfectly, but the service identity tokens cannot be created, breaking the entire authentication flow with Consul.

---

## Resolution Phase

### Solution Design

### Comprehensive Service Identity Infrastructure Restoration

#### Solution Components

1. **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Reapply ACL Policies - Updated all Nomad ACL policies with KV access
2. **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Enable Service Identity - Re-enabled on all Nomad nodes
3. **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Configure JWT Auth Method - Set up `nomad-workloads` in Consul
4. **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Create Binding Rule - Linked auth method to workload role
5. **‚ùå BLOCKED**: Configure JWT Signing Keys - Nomad config validation failure
6. **üîÑ PENDING**: Test Service Registration - Awaiting JWT signing key resolution

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: üü¢ LOW
- **Potential Impact**: Temporary service discovery interruption during restart
- **Mitigation Plan**: Apply fixes during maintenance window, have rollback procedures ready

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Reapply Service Identity ACL Policies

**Status:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**
**Objective:** Ensure all Nomad nodes have correct ACL policies for service registration

**Executed Commands:**

```bash
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/infrastructure/consul-nomad/update-all-nomad-acl-policies.yml \
  -i inventory/environments/doggos-homelab/proxmox.yml
```

**Results:**

- ‚úÖ All Nomad ACL policies updated with KV access permissions
- ‚úÖ Service registration permissions confirmed: `service_prefix "" { policy = "write" }`
- ‚úÖ All 6 Nomad nodes (3 servers + 3 clients) have proper policies
- ‚úÖ Policies include both service registration and KV access permissions

#### Step 2: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Enable Service Identity on All Nodes

**Status:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**
**Objective:** Ensure service identity is enabled on all Nomad nodes

**Executed Commands:**

```bash
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/infrastructure/consul-nomad/enable-service-identity.yml \
  -i inventory/environments/doggos-homelab/proxmox.yml
```

**Results:**

- ‚úÖ Service identity enabled on all Nomad nodes
- ‚úÖ Configuration confirmed: `service_identity { enabled = true }`
- ‚úÖ Task identity also enabled: `task_identity { enabled = true }`
- ‚úÖ Nomad servers restarted successfully
- ‚úÖ All nodes verified with proper service identity settings

#### Step 3: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Configure JWT Auth Method in Consul

**Status:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**
**Objective:** Set up JWT authentication method for Nomad workloads

**Executed Commands:**

```bash
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/infrastructure/consul-nomad/setup-jwt-auth-method.yml \
  -i inventory/environments/doggos-homelab/proxmox.yml
```

**Results:**

- ‚úÖ JWT auth method `nomad-workloads` created in Consul
- ‚úÖ JWKS URL configured: `http://192.168.11.11:4646/.well-known/jwks.json`
- ‚úÖ JWKS endpoint verified accessible and returning valid JSON
- ‚úÖ Bound audiences configured: `["consul.io"]`
- ‚úÖ Claim mappings configured for workload identity
- ‚úÖ Auth method verified: `nomad-workloads` (jwt type)

**Verification:**

```bash
# Test token generation (if accessible)
nomad alloc exec <alloc-id> /bin/sh -c 'echo $NOMAD_TOKEN | head -c 50'
```

#### Step 4: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Create Nomad Workload Role and Binding Rule

**Status:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**
**Objective:** Create proper Consul roles and binding rules for workload authentication

**Executed Commands:**

```bash
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/infrastructure/consul-nomad/setup-nomad-workload-role.yml \
  -i inventory/environments/doggos-homelab/proxmox.yml
```

**Results:**

- ‚úÖ `nomad-workload-identity` policy verified (already existed)
- ‚úÖ `nomad-workload` role verified (already existed)
- ‚úÖ Binding rule created linking `nomad-workloads` auth method to `nomad-workload` role
- ‚úÖ Selector configured: `"nomad_service" in value`
- ‚úÖ Bind type: `role`, Bind name: `nomad-workload`

#### Step 5: ‚ùå BLOCKED - Configure JWT Signing Keys in Nomad

**Status:** ‚ùå **FAILED - CONFIGURATION VALIDATION ERROR**
**Objective:** Configure JWT signing keys in Nomad for token generation

**Executed Commands:**

```bash
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/infrastructure/nomad/setup-jwt-signing.yml \
  -i inventory/environments/doggos-homelab/proxmox.yml
```

**Results:**

- ‚ùå Nomad configuration validation failed: `"unexpected keys jwt"`
- ‚ùå JWT signing key configuration rejected by Nomad v1.10.4
- ‚ùå RSA private key generated but HCL syntax not accepted
- ‚ùå Error: `failed to decode HCL file: unexpected keys jwt`

**Issue:** Nomad configuration does not recognize the `jwt` configuration block, preventing JWT token generation for service identity.

**Security Fix Applied:** JWT signing keys were initially generated in repository root (security risk). Keys have been removed and `.gitignore` updated to prevent future incidents. Updated playbook now generates keys dynamically on Nomad servers.

#### Step 6: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Redeploy PostgreSQL Job

**Status:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**
**Objective:** Force service registration with corrected infrastructure

**Executed Commands:**

```bash
nomad job run -var-file="postgresql.variables.hcl" postgresql.nomad.hcl
```

**Results:**

- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL job redeployed successfully
- ‚úÖ Job running with allocation ID `a679122e`
- ‚úÖ Database accessible on port `20639`
- ‚úÖ Service configuration includes proper identity block: `identity { aud = ["consul.io"] }`
- ‚ùå **Service registration still failing** (awaiting JWT signing key resolution)

### Testing & Validation

#### Functional Testing

[Tests to ensure the fix works]

##### Test Case 1: PostgreSQL Service Registration

**Objective:** Verify PostgreSQL registers in Consul after infrastructure fixes
**Procedure:**

```bash
# Check service catalog
consul catalog services

# Verify PostgreSQL service details
consul catalog service postgres
```

**Expected Result:** PostgreSQL appears in service catalog with correct port and tags
**Actual Result:** PostgreSQL service NOT found in Consul catalog
**Status:** ‚ùå **FAILED** - Service registration blocked by JWT signing key issue

##### Test Case 2: Service Discovery Functionality

**Objective:** Verify service discovery works for registered services
**Procedure:**

```bash
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup postgres.service.consul

# Test API access if available
curl -I http://postgres.service.consul:20639
```

**Expected Result:** DNS resolution works and service is accessible
**Actual Result:** [To be determined after fix implementation]
**Status:** ‚ùì NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

#### Regression Testing

[Tests to ensure we didn't break anything]

##### Regression Test 1: Existing Services Remain Functional

**Status:** ‚ùì NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

##### Regression Test 2: Nomad Job Execution Still Works

**Status:** ‚ùì NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
