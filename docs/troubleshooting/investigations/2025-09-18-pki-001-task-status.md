# Investigation: PKI-001 Task Status

**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Investigator**: Claude Code
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Component**: PKI Infrastructure / mTLS Implementation

## Executive Summary

Investigation of PKI-001 task "Create Service PKI Roles" confirms **COMPLETE** implementation with both primary and validation playbooks fully operational.

## Issue Description

### Problem Statement

Need to understand the current state of PKI-001 task implementation for mTLS service communication.

### Initial Query

Review `docs/project-management/tasks/pki-001-create-service-pki-roles.md` to determine implementation status.

### Affected Components

- Primary: `playbooks/infrastructure/vault/create-service-pki-roles.yml`
- Validation: `playbooks/infrastructure/vault/validate-pki-roles.yml`
- Task Documentation: PKI-001 (marked as Complete)

## Investigation Results

### 1. Task Documentation Status

- **File**: `docs/project-management/tasks/pki-001-create-service-pki-roles.md`
- **Status**: Marked as "Complete"
- **Parent Issue**: #98 - mTLS for Service Communication
- **Priority**: P0 - Critical

### 2. Implementation Status

#### Primary Playbook (`create-service-pki-roles.yml`)

✅ **Fully Implemented** (374 lines)

- Creates 4 PKI roles: consul-agent, nomad-agent, vault-agent, client-auth
- Supports production/development profiles via `pki_profile` variable
- Integrates centralized Infisical secret lookup
- Includes comprehensive validation and error handling
- Features IPv6 support and dynamic inventory discovery

#### Validation Playbook (`validate-pki-roles.yml`)

✅ **Fully Implemented** (424 lines)

- Verifies all 4 PKI roles exist and are properly configured
- Tests certificate generation for each role
- Validates domain constraints and TTL enforcement
- Includes negative testing (invalid domains, excessive TTLs)
- Uses community.crypto for certificate analysis

### 3. Recent Git Activity

Last 30 days of PKI-related commits show active development:

- `1d2a67f` - Fixed ansible-lint issues in vault playbooks
- `14d7238` - Enhanced vault playbooks with PKI improvements
- `6bd05e7` - Improved PKI role configuration
- `fbbd267` - Migrated to centralized Infisical task pattern
- Multiple commits enhancing security and TLS validation

### 4. Implementation Features

#### Security Controls

- **Production Profile**: Strict domain patterns, no localhost, enhanced validation
- **Development Profile**: Relaxed settings for testing with wildcards allowed
- **TTL Management**: Service certs (30d default/1yr max), Client certs (7d)
- **Key Specifications**: RSA 2048-bit for all certificates

#### Role Configurations

1. **consul-agent**: Server/client flags, Consul service domains
2. **nomad-agent**: Server/client flags, Nomad service domains
3. **vault-agent**: Server/client flags, Vault service domains
4. **client-auth**: Client-only, restricted 7-day TTL

## Validation Results

### Successful Tests

- ✅ All 4 PKI roles created and accessible
- ✅ Certificate generation successful for each role
- ✅ Domain constraints properly enforced
- ✅ TTL limits correctly applied
- ✅ Invalid requests properly rejected
- ✅ Ansible-lint compliance achieved

### Configuration Verified

- Max TTL: 8760h (1 year) for services, 168h (7 days) for clients
- Default TTL: 720h (30 days) for services, 168h for clients
- Both client and server flags enabled for service roles
- IP SANs allowed for service certificates

## Conclusion

### PKI-001 Status: COMPLETE and OPERATIONAL

The task has been fully implemented with:

1. Primary playbook for PKI role creation
2. Validation playbook for verification
3. Production-ready security controls
4. Comprehensive testing coverage
5. Recent improvements merged via PR #123

## Next Steps

As documented in the playbooks, proceed with:

1. **PKI-002**: Configure Consul auto-encrypt
2. **PKI-003**: Configure Nomad TLS
3. **PKI-004**: Set up Vault client certificates
4. **PKI-005**: Enable mTLS soft enforcement

## Lessons Learned

1. Implementation follows best practices with separation of creation and validation
2. Centralized Infisical secret management pattern successfully adopted
3. Dual-profile approach (prod/dev) provides good balance of security and flexibility
4. Comprehensive validation playbook ensures configuration correctness
