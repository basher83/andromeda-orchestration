# PostgreSQL Service Registration Investigation

**Investigation ID**: 2025-09-09-postgresql-service-registration
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Priority**: üü° HIGH
**Started**: 2025-09-09
**Resolved**: 2025-09-09

## Issue Summary

### Problem Statement

PostgreSQL Nomad job was running successfully but not registering as a service in Consul, preventing service discovery and health monitoring. **RESOLVED**: Service registration is now working after fixing duplicate service blocks and verifying ACL authentication.

### Initial Symptoms

- [x] PostgreSQL job shows "running" status in Nomad UI
- [x] Database is accessible on port 20639 via direct connection
- [x] TCP health checks are passing (verified with `nc -zv`)
- [x] Service does not appear in `consul catalog services`
- [x] Even Traefik (known working service) is not registering in Consul

### Affected Components

- **Primary**: PostgreSQL Nomad job service registration
- **Secondary**: Consul service discovery, Nomad-Consul integration
- **Environment**: Production Nomad cluster (3 servers, 3 clients)

### Business Impact

Service discovery is broken for all services, preventing automated load balancing, health monitoring, and inter-service communication.

---

## Research Phase

### Initial Investigation

User reported PostgreSQL job failure, but investigation revealed the job is actually running successfully - the issue is specifically with service registration in Consul.

#### Commands Run

```bash
# Check job status
nomad job status postgresql

# Check service catalog
consul catalog services

# Test database connectivity
nc -zv 192.168.11.21 20639

# Check Nomad allocation logs
nomad alloc logs 337f3f52 postgres
```

#### Findings

- [x] PostgreSQL job is running with allocation ID 337f3f52
- [x] Database is listening on port 20639 and accepting connections
- [x] No error logs in PostgreSQL or init-pdns tasks
- [x] Consul catalog shows only `netdata-child` service
- [x] TCP connectivity to PostgreSQL works perfectly

### Literature Review

Reviewed existing troubleshooting documentation for service registration issues.

#### Internal References

- [x] `docs/troubleshooting/service-identity-issues.md` - Documents JWT auth method issues
- [x] `docs/troubleshooting/consul-kv-templating-issues.md` - ACL permission issues
- [x] `docs/implementation/consul/nomad-workloads-auth.md` - JWT auth method setup
- [x] `docs/implementation/nomad/consul-health-checks.md` - Service registration patterns

#### External References

- [x] Nomad Service Identity Documentation
- [x] Consul JWT Auth Methods
- [x] HashiCorp Nomad-Consul Integration Guide

### Hypothesis Formation

[Initial theories about what might be causing the issue]

#### Hypothesis 1: Missing Service Identity Configuration

**Evidence:**

- Documentation shows service identity is required for Consul registration
- Job file should include `identity { aud = ["consul.io"] }` block

**Test Plan:**

- Check current PostgreSQL job configuration
- Verify service identity blocks are present
- Compare with working service configurations

#### Hypothesis 2: JWT Auth Method Issues

**Evidence:**

- Service identity requires working JWT auth method
- Previous issues with `nomad-workloads` auth method configuration

**Test Plan:**

- Verify JWT auth method exists and is configured
- Check JWKS endpoint accessibility
- Test token generation process

#### Hypothesis 3: ACL Policy Issues

**Evidence:**

- ACL policies must include service registration permissions
- Previous KV access issues required policy updates

**Test Plan:**

- Check Nomad client/server ACL policies
- Verify service registration permissions
- Test policy application across all nodes

---

## Diagnosis Phase

### Systematic Testing

[Structured testing to validate/invalidate hypotheses]

#### Test 1: Service Configuration Verification

**Objective:** Verify PostgreSQL job has correct service identity configuration
**Procedure:**

```bash
# Check current job configuration
nomad job inspect postgresql | jq '.Job.TaskGroups[0].Tasks[0].Services'

# Verify identity block exists
grep -A 5 "identity" nomad-jobs/platform-services/postgresql/postgresql.nomad.hcl
```

**Expected Result:** Service block contains identity block with `aud = ["consul.io"]`
**Actual Result:** Identity block is present and correctly configured
**Conclusion:** ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Identity block exists

#### Test 2: JWT Auth Method Verification

**Objective:** Verify Consul JWT auth method is working
**Procedure:**

```bash
# Check auth method configuration
curl -s http://192.168.11.11:8500/v1/acl/auth-methods | jq .

# Test JWKS endpoint
curl -I http://192.168.11.11:4646/.well-known/jwks.json
```

**Expected Result:** JWT auth method exists and JWKS endpoint is accessible
**Actual Result:** Cannot access auth methods due to ACL restrictions
**Conclusion:** ‚ùì INCONCLUSIVE - Need proper authentication to test

#### Test 3: Cluster-wide Service Registration

**Objective:** Verify if this is a cluster-wide issue
**Procedure:**

```bash
# Check all services in catalog
consul catalog services

# Check Traefik service specifically
consul catalog service traefik
```

**Expected Result:** Multiple services registered including Traefik
**Actual Result:** Only `netdata-child` service visible
**Conclusion:** ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - This is a cluster-wide service registration issue

### Root Cause Analysis

[Final determination of the actual cause]

#### Confirmed Root Cause

**PRIMARY ISSUE**: Multiple Configuration Issues Preventing Service Registration

The root cause was a combination of configuration issues that prevented service registration:

1. **Duplicate Service Blocks**: ‚ùå **FIXED** - PostgreSQL job had duplicate service definitions at group and task level
2. **Duplicate Consul Blocks**: ‚ùå **FIXED** - Nomad configuration had duplicate Consul blocks, one missing `auto = true`
3. **Service Identity Configuration**: ‚ùå **FIXED** - `service_identity { auto = true }` was missing in one Consul block
4. **Job Configuration**: ‚úÖ PostgreSQL job has correct identity block (`aud = ["consul.io"]`)
5. **JWT Auth Method**: ‚úÖ Already configured in Consul (`nomad-workloads`)
6. **JWKS Endpoint**: ‚úÖ Working and accessible
7. **ACL Authentication**: ‚úÖ Services visible with proper Consul token authentication

#### Contributing Factors

- [x] **RESOLVED**: Duplicate service blocks in PostgreSQL job removed
- [x] **RESOLVED**: Duplicate Consul configuration blocks in Nomad removed
- [x] **RESOLVED**: Service identity `auto = true` setting corrected
- [x] **RESOLVED**: ACL policies verified as working
- [x] **RESOLVED**: PostgreSQL service now registered and visible in Consul

#### Why It Wasn't Initially Obvious

The issue appeared as a "service registration failure" but was actually caused by **duplicate configuration blocks** and **missing service identity settings**. The services were actually registering but were only visible with proper Consul ACL authentication tokens - using `consul catalog services` without authentication showed limited results due to ACL restrictions.

## Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

### Resolution Summary

The PostgreSQL service registration issue was resolved by fixing configuration problems in both the Nomad job and Nomad agent configuration:

1. **Removed duplicate service blocks** in the PostgreSQL job file (kept group-level, removed task-level)
2. **Fixed duplicate Consul configuration blocks** in Nomad agent configuration
3. **Ensured `service_identity { auto = true }`** was set in the Consul configuration
4. **Verified service registration** using proper Consul ACL authentication

The services were actually registering but were not visible without authentication due to ACL restrictions. The fix ensures clean configuration and proper service registration.
