# Infrastructure as Code Smoke Testing Theory

## Executive Summary

Smoke testing in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) represents a critical validation layer that bridges the gap between infrastructure provisioning and production readiness. This document provides the theoretical foundation and industry context for our smoke testing implementation.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Definition in IaC Context

In Infrastructure as Code deployments, smoke tests are **lightweight, automated validation checks** that verify the basic functionality and connectivity of provisioned infrastructure immediately after deployment. Unlike traditional software smoke tests that focus on application functionality, IaC smoke tests validate:

1. **Infrastructure Resources**: Existence and accessibility of provisioned resources
2. **Network Connectivity**: Communication paths between components
3. **Service Configuration**: Basic operational status of configured services
4. **Security Posture**: Authentication, authorization, and access controls

### The Testing Pyramid in IaC

```text
                    /\
                   /  \    End-to-End Tests
                  /    \   (Full stack validation)
                 /------\
                /        \  Integration Tests
               /          \ (Multi-component)
              /------------\
             /              \ Smoke Tests
            /                \(Critical path)
           /------------------\
          /                    \ Unit Tests
         /                      \(Individual components)
        /________________________\
```

Smoke tests occupy a unique position in the IaC testing pyramid:

- **Above Unit Tests**: More comprehensive than isolated component testing
- **Below Integration Tests**: Faster and more focused than full integration testing
- **First Line of Defense**: Catch critical failures before they cascade

## IaC-Specific Challenges

### 1. Infrastructure State Management

Unlike application code, infrastructure has persistent state that affects testing:

- **State Dependencies**: Tests must account for existing infrastructure state
- **Resource Lifecycle**: Creation, modification, and destruction have different test requirements
- **Drift Detection**: Infrastructure can drift from desired state between deployments

### 2. Multi-Tool Orchestration

Modern IaC deployments typically involve multiple tools:

- **Provisioning Layer**: Terraform, OpenTofu, CloudFormation
- **Configuration Layer**: Ansible, Chef, Puppet
- **Orchestration Layer**: Nomad, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm

Each layer requires specific validation approaches:

```yaml
# Example: Multi-layer validation
Infrastructure Layer (Terraform):
  - VPC exists and is configured correctly
  - Security groups allow required traffic
  - Instances are running

Platform Layer (Ansible):
  - Required packages are installed
  - Services are configured and running
  - File permissions are correct

Application Layer (Combined):
  - Applications respond to health checks
  - APIs return expected responses
  - End-to-end workflows function
```

### 3. Environment Variability

IaC deployments must work across multiple environments:

- **Development**: Rapid iteration, minimal resources
- **Staging**: Production-like, full testing
- **Production**: High availability, zero-downtime requirements

Smoke tests must adapt to each environment's characteristics while maintaining consistency in validation approach.

## Smoke Testing Patterns for IaC

### Pattern 1: Layered Validation

Test each infrastructure layer independently before testing interactions:

```text
1. Infrastructure Tests (Post-Terraform)
   ├── Resource Creation
   ├── Network Connectivity
   └── Security Rules

2. Configuration Tests (Post-Ansible)
   ├── Service Status
   ├── Package Installation
   └── System Configuration

3. Application Tests (Post-Deployment)
   ├── Health Endpoints
   ├── API Availability
   └── Data Flow
```

### Pattern 2: Progressive Enhancement

Start with basic connectivity and progressively test more complex functionality:

```text
Level 1: Connectivity
  - Can reach the host
  - Ports are open
  - DNS resolves

Level 2: Authentication
  - Can authenticate
  - Tokens are valid
  - Permissions work

Level 3: Operations
  - Can perform reads
  - Can perform writes
  - Transactions complete

Level 4: Integration
  - Services communicate
  - Data flows correctly
  - Workflows complete
```

### Pattern 3: Fail-Fast with Context

Design tests to fail quickly while providing maximum diagnostic information:

```yaml
# Good: Fail-fast with context
- name: Test Vault connectivity
  block:
    - name: Check network connectivity
      wait_for:
        host: "{{ vault_host }}"
        port: 8200
        timeout: 5
      register: network_check

    - name: Check API accessibility
      uri:
        url: "https://{{ vault_host }}:8200/v1/sys/health"
        timeout: 5
      register: api_check

  rescue:
    - name: Provide diagnostic information
      debug:
        msg: |
          Network check: {{ network_check | default('Failed') }}
          API check: {{ api_check | default('Failed') }}
          Suggested actions:
          - Verify Vault service is running
          - Check firewall rules
          - Validate TLS certificates
```

## Tool-Specific Implementations

### Terraform/OpenTofu Smoke Testing

#### Native Approaches

1. **Check Blocks** (Terraform 1.5+)

```hcl
check "health_check" {
  data "http" "app" {
    url = "https://${aws_instance.web.public_ip}/health"
  }

  assert {
    condition     = data.http.app.status_code == 200
    error_message = "Application health check failed"
  }
}
```

1. **Postconditions**

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ... configuration ...

  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      condition     = self.instance_state == "running"
      error_message = "Instance failed to start"
    }
  }
}
```

1. **Terraform Test Framework**

```hcl
# tests/smoke.tftest.hcl
run "validate_infrastructure" {
  command = apply

  assert {
    condition     = aws_instance.web.instance_state == "running"
    error_message = "Web instance is not running"
  }
}
```

### Ansible Smoke Testing

#### Native Approaches

1. **Assert Module**

```yaml
- name: Validate service status
  service_facts:

- assert:
    that:
      - ansible_facts.services['nginx.service'].state == 'running'
    fail_msg: "Nginx service is not running"
    success_msg: "Nginx service is active"
```

1. **URI Module for API Testing**

```yaml
- name: Test application endpoint
  uri:
    url: "http://{{ app_host }}/api/health"
    method: GET
    status_code: 200
  register: health_check

- assert:
    that:
      - health_check.json.status == 'healthy'
```

#### Molecule Framework

Molecule provides structured testing for Ansible roles:

```yaml
# molecule/default/molecule.yml
dependency:
  name: galaxy
driver:
  name: docker
platforms:
  - name: instance
    image: ubuntu:22.04
provisioner:
  name: ansible
verifier:
  name: ansible
  directory: ./verify
```

```yaml
# molecule/default/verify/verify.yml
- name: Verify
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Check if service is installed
      package:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      check_mode: yes
      register: pkg_check

    - assert:
        that:
          - not pkg_check.changed
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Design Principles

#### Fast Execution

- Target < 60 seconds total execution time
- Parallelize independent tests
- Use appropriate timeouts

#### Critical Path Focus

- Test only essential functionality
- Avoid comprehensive validation in smoke tests
- Leave detailed testing for integration tests

#### Idempotency

- Tests should produce consistent results
- Multiple runs should not affect outcomes
- Clean up test artifacts

### 2. Implementation Guidelines

#### Clear Failure Messages

```yaml
# Good
assert:
  that: service_running
  fail_msg: |
    PostgreSQL service is not running.
    Action required:
    1. SSH to {{ inventory_hostname }}
    2. Run: sudo systemctl start postgresql
    3. Check logs: sudo journalctl -u postgresql -n 50

# Bad
assert:
  that: service_running
  fail_msg: "Service check failed"
```

#### Environment Adaptation

```yaml
# Adapt tests to environment
- name: Set test parameters
  set_fact:
    test_timeout: "{{ 'production' in group_names | ternary(30, 10) }}"
    test_parallel: "{{ 'production' in group_names | ternary(false, true) }}"
```

### 3. CI/CD Integration

#### Pipeline Gates

```yaml
# GitHub Actions Example
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: Provision Infrastructure
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve

      - name: Run Infrastructure Smoke Tests
        run: |
          ansible-playbook smoke-tests/infrastructure.yml
          if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "Infrastructure smoke tests failed"
            terraform destroy -auto-approve
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Configure Services
        run: ansible-playbook site.yml

      - name: Run Service Smoke Tests
        run: ansible-playbook smoke-tests/services.yml
```

#### Parallel Execution

```yaml
# Run multiple smoke tests concurrently
- name: Execute smoke tests in parallel
  ansible.builtin.async_status:
    jid: "{{ item.ansible_job_id }}"
  register: job_result
  until: job_result.finished
  retries: 30
  delay: 2
  loop: "{{ smoke_test_jobs.results }}"
```

## Conclusion

Smoke testing in Infrastructure as Code represents a critical quality gate that ensures infrastructure reliability and operational readiness. By implementing comprehensive smoke tests that validate infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and service availability, organizations can:

1. **Reduce Deployment Failures**: Catch issues before they impact production
2. **Accelerate Delivery**: Provide rapid feedback on infrastructure changes
3. **Improve Reliability**: Ensure consistent infrastructure behavior
4. **Enable Confidence**: Allow teams to deploy with certainty

The key to successful IaC smoke testing lies in balancing comprehensiveness with speed, providing clear actionable feedback, and continuously evolving tests to match infrastructure changes.
