# Development Workflow Standards

## Purpose

Define the end-to-end workflow from local development to production deployment.

## Background

[TODO]: Add background on why standardized workflows improve velocity and reduce errors

## Standard

### Local Development Setup

[TODO]: Document required tools and environment setup:

- uv for Python management
- Pre-commit hooks
- Editor configurations
- Environment variables

### Pre-commit Workflow

[TODO]: Define what happens before code is committed:

- Linting checks
- Security scans
- Test execution
- Documentation updates
- Tag verification (see [Tagging Standards](./documentation-standards.md#tagging-standards))

### Code Review Process

[TODO]: Document review requirements:

- Who reviews what
- Approval requirements
- Feedback incorporation
- Merge criteria

### Deployment Procedures

[TODO]: Define deployment steps:

- Testing requirements
- Approval gates
- Deployment order
- Validation steps

### Rollback Strategies

[TODO]: Document how to safely rollback:

- Rollback triggers
- Rollback procedures
- Data considerations
- Communication requirements

## Rationale

[TODO]: Explain why structured workflows prevent issues and improve quality

## Examples

### Good Example

[TODO]: Show ideal development flow from idea to production

### Bad Example

[TODO]: Show problematic workflow patterns

## Exceptions

[TODO]: When to bypass normal workflow (emergencies, etc.)

## Migration

[TODO]: How to adopt these workflows in existing projects
