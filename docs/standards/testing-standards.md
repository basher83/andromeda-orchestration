# Testing Standards

## Purpose

Define testing strategies that ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and maintain reliability.

## Background

[TODO]: Add background on testing philosophy and what types of failures we're preventing

## Standard

### When to Write Tests

[TODO]: Define criteria for when tests are required vs optional

### Test Naming Conventions

[TODO]: Document naming patterns for test files and test functions

### Coverage Requirements

[TODO]: Define minimum coverage percentages and what should be covered

### Pre-deployment Testing Checklist

[TODO]: List all tests that must pass before deployment

### Testing in CI/CD

[TODO]: Define automated testing requirements and gates

### Test Types

[TODO]: Document different test types and when to use each:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Syntax checks
- Security scans
- Performance tests

## Rationale

[TODO]: Explain why comprehensive testing is critical for infrastructure code

## Examples

### Good Example

[TODO]: Show well-structured test examples

### Bad Example

[TODO]: Show common testing anti-patterns

## Exceptions

[TODO]: When testing requirements can be relaxed

## Migration

[TODO]: How to add tests to existing untested code
