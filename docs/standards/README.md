# Standards and Operating Procedures

This directory contains the standards, conventions, and operating procedures that govern this repository. These documents explain not just _what_ we do, but more importantly _why_ we do it this way.

üìö **Note**: These standards complement and extend the central standards defined in [Mission Control](https://github.com/basher83/docs/tree/main/mission-control/README.md). When in doubt, defer to Mission Control for organization-wide standards.

## üéØ Purpose

These standards exist to:

1. **Ensure Consistency** - Everyone follows the same patterns
2. **Preserve Knowledge** - Document the "why" behind decisions
3. **Accelerate Onboarding** - New contributors understand our approach
4. **Prevent Regression** - Avoid repeating past mistakes
5. **Enable Scale** - Patterns that work at any size

## üìù Creating New Standards

When adding a new standard:

1. **Document the Problem** - What issue does this solve?
2. **Explain the Decision** - Why this approach over alternatives?
3. **Provide Examples** - Show correct implementation
4. **List Exceptions** - When NOT to follow the standard
5. **Include Migration Path** - How to update existing code

## üîÑ Updating Standards

Standards evolve. When updating:

1. Document the change reason
2. Update all affected standards
3. Create migration guides if needed
4. Communicate changes clearly

## üåê Relationship with Mission Control

This repository's standards are part of a larger ecosystem:

### Hierarchy

1. **[Mission Control](https://github.com/basher83/docs/tree/main/mission-control/README.md)** - Organization-wide standards and policies
2. **Repository Standards** (this directory) - Project-specific implementations
3. **Service Standards** - Individual service requirements

### When to Use Which

- **Mission Control**: For organization-wide patterns, tooling decisions, and overarching policies
- **Repository Standards**: For project-specific implementations of those patterns
- **Service Documentation**: For service-specific configurations and procedures

### Conflict Resolution

If there's a conflict between standards:

1. Mission Control takes precedence for organization-wide decisions
2. Repository standards can extend but not contradict Mission Control
3. Document any necessary deviations with clear rationale
