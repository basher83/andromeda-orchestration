# Project Management Standards

## Purpose

Define how projects, tasks, and progress are tracked to ensure visibility, accountability, and successful delivery in infrastructure automation projects.

## Background

Infrastructure automation projects involve complex dependencies, multiple systems, and potential for significant impact. Structured project management prevents scope creep, ensures clear communication, and provides predictable delivery. These standards were developed from the operational patterns in our DNS/IPAM implementation and are designed to scale across all infrastructure initiatives.

## Standard

### Task Tracking

#### Task Organization System

All tasks must be tracked in a central task list with clear categorization:

**Task Format:**

```markdown
#### [Priority #] Task Title
**Description**: Clear, actionable description of the task
**Status**: Not Started | In Progress | Completed | Blocked
**Blockers**: None | Specific blocking issues
**Related**: Links to relevant documentation or dependencies

Tasks:
- [ ] Specific subtask 1
- [ ] Specific subtask 2
- [x] Completed subtask 3
```

**Priority Levels:**

- **Critical**: System down or security issue (resolve immediately)
- **High**: Implementation blockers or urgent requirements (1-3 days)
- **Medium**: Important features or improvements (1-2 weeks)
- **Low**: Nice-to-have or future enhancements (as time permits)

**Status Definitions:**

- **Not Started**: Task defined but work hasn't begun
- **In Progress**: Active work underway
- **Completed**: Task finished and verified
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

#### Task Decomposition Guidelines

Break down large tasks into actionable subtasks:

- Each subtask should be completable in < 1 day
- Use checkbox format for easy progress tracking
- Group related subtasks under parent tasks
- Include verification steps in subtasks

### Documentation Requirements

#### Project Documentation Structure

```

- Timeline met

### Communication Standards

#### Status Update Frequency

**Daily Standup Format** (during active implementation):

- What was completed yesterday
- What's planned for today
- Current blockers
- Help needed

**Weekly Status Reports**:

```markdown
## Week of [Date]

### Completed This Week
- Major accomplishment 1
- Major accomplishment 2

### Planned Next Week
- Priority task 1
- Priority task 2

### Blockers & Risks
- Issue 1: Impact and mitigation
- Risk 1: Probability and plan

### Metrics
- Tasks completed: X/Y
- Progress: X%
- Timeline: On track | At risk | Delayed
```

#### Stakeholder Communication

**Project Kickoff**:

- Objectives and success criteria
- Timeline and milestones
- Team and responsibilities
- Communication plan

**Phase Completion**:

- Achievements
- Lessons learned
- Next phase preview
- Updated timeline

**Project Completion**:

- Final deliverables
- Success metrics
- Handoff documentation
- Retrospective results

### Risk Management

#### Risk Register Format

```markdown
## Risk: [Title]
**Probability**: Low | Medium | High
**Impact**: Low | Medium | High
**Category**: Technical | Resource | Timeline | External
**Mitigation**: Planned response
**Owner**: Responsible person
**Status**: Active | Mitigated | Closed
```

#### Risk Categories

**Technical Risks**:

- Integration failures
- Performance issues
- Data loss
- Security vulnerabilities

**Resource Risks**:

- Key person dependencies
- Hardware availability
- Budget constraints
- Time limitations

**External Risks**:

- Vendor changes
- Compliance requirements
- Infrastructure failures

### Decision Tracking

#### Decision Process

1. **Problem Statement**: Clear description of issue
2. **Options Analysis**: Evaluate alternatives
3. **Recommendation**: Proposed solution with rationale
4. **Review**: Team/stakeholder input
5. **Decision**: Final choice with reasoning
6. **Implementation**: Action items and timeline

#### Change Management

**Change Request Format**:

```markdown
## Change Request: [Title]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Requester**: Name
**Priority**: Critical | High | Medium | Low
**Impact**: Systems/services affected
**Justification**: Why this change is needed
**Implementation Plan**: How to implement
**Rollback Plan**: How to revert if needed
**Approval**: Required approvals
**Status**: Pending | Approved | Implemented | Rejected
```

## Rationale

Structured project management provides:

1. **Visibility**: All stakeholders understand progress and issues
2. **Accountability**: Clear ownership and responsibilities
3. **Predictability**: Consistent delivery patterns
4. **Quality**: Systematic approach reduces errors
5. **Learning**: Documented decisions and outcomes for future projects
6. **Risk Reduction**: Early identification and mitigation of issues

## Examples

### Good Example - Well-Managed Task

```markdown
#### 5. Deploy PowerDNS to Nomad
**Description**: Deploy PowerDNS as authoritative DNS server in Nomad
**Status**: Completed (2025-08-01)
**Blockers**: None
**Related**: PowerDNS Nomad job, Phase 2 of ROADMAP

Tasks:
- [x] Generate secure passwords for MySQL and API access
- [x] Store PowerDNS secrets in Consul KV
- [x] Create host volumes on Nomad clients
- [x] Deploy PowerDNS Nomad job
- [x] Verify services are running and healthy

**Deployment Details**:
- Running on nomad-client-1 (allocation: b87b56bf)
- DNS service: 192.168.11.20:53
- API service: Dynamic port via Traefik
```

### Bad Example - Poorly Tracked Task

```markdown
#### DNS Migration
Need to move DNS from old system to new system.
Status: Working on it
- Setup new DNS
- Move records
- Test everything
```

### Good Example - Risk Documentation

```markdown
## Risk: Pi-hole HA Cluster Migration Complexity
**Probability**: High
**Impact**: High
**Category**: Technical
**Mitigation**:
- Document current HA configuration thoroughly
- Create detailed migration runbook
- Test migration in dev environment
- Plan phased rollout with rollback capability
**Owner**: Infrastructure Team
**Status**: Active

**Updates**:
- 2025-07-30: Documentation completed in docs/operations/pihole-ha-cluster.md
- 2025-08-01: Dev environment testing scheduled for next sprint
```

## Exceptions

Lighter-weight project management is acceptable for:

1. **Emergency Fixes**: Document after resolution
2. **Small Changes**: < 4 hours effort, low risk
3. **Experimentation**: Proof of concepts or research
4. **Documentation Updates**: Unless major restructuring

Even exceptions should have minimal documentation:

- What was done
- Why it was urgent/small
- Any follow-up needed

## Migration

### Adopting Standards for Existing Projects

1. **Assessment** (Week 1):
   - Create initial task list from current state
