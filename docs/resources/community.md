### Netdata Community Configuration Management

- **URL**: <https://github.com/netdata/community/tree/main/configuration-management>
- **Type**: Integration examples and patterns
- **Use Case**: Ansible playbooks for Netdata deployment and Consul integration examples for service discovery and monitoring - shows patterns for integrating monitoring with our existing Consul infrastructure
- **Date Added**: 2025-01-05
- **Status**: To Review
- **Notes**: We already have some of these patterns in our repo but haven't fully utilized them. Check the ansible/ and consul/ subdirectories for specific examples. Could help us properly integrate Netdata monitoring with our Consul service mesh. **UPDATE: The Consul integration actually uses Consul Template (see tools-utilities.md) - great example of it in action!**
