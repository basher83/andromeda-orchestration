# Resources and References

## Purpose

This directory serves as a lightweight knowledge base for capturing potentially useful resources, tools, and references discovered during development. It's designed for quick annotation of findings that may benefit the project, allowing for later evaluation and implementation decisions.

## How to Use

1. **When you find something interesting**: Add it to the appropriate file
2. **Keep entries brief**: Just enough context to evaluate later
3. **Update status**: Mark items as you review or implement them
4. **Clean up periodically**: Archive or remove outdated entries

## Categories

### [ansible-plugins.md](./ansible-plugins.md)

Ansible modules, lookup plugins, filter plugins, collections, and roles that could enhance our automation capabilities.

### [tools-utilities.md](./tools-utilities.md)

CLI tools, scripts, utilities, and applications that could improve our workflow or infrastructure management.

### [references.md](./references.md)

Articles, tutorials, documentation, best practices, and learning resources relevant to our stack.

### [community.md](./community.md)

Open source projects, GitHub repositories, and community solutions that demonstrate similar patterns or solve related problems.

## Entry Format

Each entry should include:

- **Name/Title**: Clear identifier
- **URL**: Link to the resource
- **Type**: Specific category (e.g., lookup plugin, Nomad job, Python library)
- **Use Case**: Brief description of how it might help
- **Date Added**: When you found it
- **Status**: `To Review` | `Reviewing` | `Implemented` | `Rejected`
- **Notes**: Any additional thoughts or context

## Example Entry

```markdown
## ansible-merge-vars
- **URL**: https://github.com/leapfrogonline/ansible-merge-vars
- **Type**: Action plugin
- **Use Case**: Deep merging of variables across different sources, useful for complex configurations
- **Date Added**: 2025-01-05
- **Status**: To Review
- **Notes**: Could simplify our multi-environment variable management
```

## Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Find interesting resource → Add quick entry
2. **Review**: Evaluate feasibility and fit → Update status and notes
3. **Decision**: Implement, reject, or defer → Document reasoning
4. **Implementation**: If approved → Create task, update status to Implemented

## Tips

- Don't overthink entries - capture first, evaluate later
- Include enough context to remember why it seemed useful
- Link to related issues or tasks when implementing
- Consider security implications for any external dependencies
