## Key Findings
1. Nomad is installed and active on all nodes
2. Version: v1.10.2 across all nodes
3. ACLs appear to be enabled (commands require token)
4. Docker is available on all client nodes
5. Sufficient resources for workload deployment

## Recommendations
1. Store Nomad ACL token in Infisical for automation
2. Create job specifications for core services
3. Set up Nomad-Consul integration for service discovery
4. Implement job templates for common workloads
5. Configure Nomad autoscaler for dynamic scaling
