# Infrastructure Assessment Report
Date: 2025-07-26T00:00:00Z
Phase: Phase 0 - Infrastructure Assessment
Assessed By: infrastructure-assessment-analyst

## Executive Summary
- Overall readiness score: 7/10
- Critical findings: 3
- Blocking issues:
  - Infisical authentication configuration needs verification
  - Inter-cluster connectivity not fully documented
  - DNS/IPAM current state audit incomplete

## Detailed Findings

### Consul Cluster Health

Based on the assessment from 2025-07-24:

**Strengths:**
- Consul cluster operational with 3 servers and 3 clients
- All nodes showing "alive" status
- Encryption enabled (serf_lan encrypted = true)
- ACLs enabled
- Raft consensus working (leader at 192.168.11.12:8300)

**Concerns:**
- Mixed client versions (1.21.2 vs 1.20.5 on nomad-client-3)
- No registered services visible (services = 0)
- DNS port 8600 status needs verification
- No health checks configured

**Risk Level:** Medium - Core cluster healthy but lacks service registrations

### DNS/IPAM Analysis

**Current State:**
- Pi-hole + Unbound deployed (per documentation)
- No centralized IPAM solution
- Ad-hoc IP allocation management
- DNS zones and authoritative domains not documented

**Missing Information:**
- Complete DNS zone inventory
- Current IP allocation by subnet
- DHCP server locations and configurations
- DNS resolution paths and dependencies

**Risk Level:** High - Current state not fully documented

### Infrastructure Resources

Based on doggos-homelab assessment:

**Available Resources (per node):**
- CPU: 4 cores per node
- RAM: 15GB total, ~14GB available
- Storage: 65GB disks with ~58GB free (12% usage)
- Container Runtime: Docker 28.3.0 installed

**Capacity Analysis:**
- Can support NetBox (requires 4GB RAM, 20GB disk)
- Can support PowerDNS (requires 1GB RAM, 10GB disk)
- Can support MariaDB + PostgreSQL (4GB RAM, 50GB disk combined)
- Sufficient headroom for HA deployments

**Risk Level:** Low - Adequate resources available

### Multi-Cluster Connectivity

**Known Configuration:**
- og-homelab cluster at 192.168.10.x (Proxmox at .2)
- doggos-homelab cluster at 192.168.11.x
- Both clusters have Proxmox dynamic inventory configured

**Unknown/Unverified:**
- Network routing between clusters
- Firewall rules between segments
- VPN or direct connectivity
- Latency measurements

**Risk Level:** High - Inter-cluster connectivity not verified

### Security Posture

**Strengths:**
- Dual secret management systems (1Password + Infisical)
- No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- Consul ACLs enabled
- Consul encryption enabled

**Concerns:**
- Migration from 1Password to Infisical in progress
- Infisical secrets at unorganized path (/apollo-13/)
- Secret rotation policies not documented
- Certificate management not implemented

**Risk Level:** Medium - Security controls present but incomplete

### Service Orchestration Readiness

**Nomad Status:**
- Version 1.10.2 deployed across all nodes
- Both server and client agents running
- Docker driver available
- Consul integration present but not fully configured

**Missing Components:**
- Persistent volume configuration for stateful services
- CSI drivers for storage orchestration
- Ingress/load balancing strategy
- Service mesh configuration

**Risk Level:** Medium - Core platform ready but needs enhancement

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

1. **DNS/IPAM State Unknown**
   - Impact: Cannot plan migration without current state
   - Mitigation: Execute comprehensive DNS/IPAM audit
   - Recovery Time: N/A (assessment only)

2. **Inter-Cluster Connectivity**
   - Impact: Services may not communicate across clusters
   - Mitigation: Document and test all network paths
   - Recovery Time: Hours if misconfigured

3. **Secret Management Transition**
   - Impact: Authentication failures during migration
   - Mitigation: Maintain dual systems during transition
   - Recovery Time: Minutes with proper fallback

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **Consul Service Registration**
   - Impact: Service discovery non-functional
   - Mitigation: Implement registration framework first
   - Recovery Time: Minutes to register services

2. **Storage Persistence**
   - Impact: Data loss on container restart
   - Mitigation: Configure Nomad host volumes or CSI
   - Recovery Time: Hours to restore from backup

3. **Version Inconsistencies**
   - Impact: Potential compatibility issues
   - Mitigation: Standardize versions across nodes
   - Recovery Time: Minutes per node upgrade

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Phase 0)

1. **Complete DNS/IPAM Audit**
   ```bash
   uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/assessment/dns-ipam-audit.yml -i inventory/og-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml
   ```
   - Document all DNS zones
   - Map IP allocations
   - Identify authoritative servers

2. **Verify Inter-Cluster Connectivity**
   ```bash
   uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/assessment/network-connectivity.yml -i inventory/og-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml
   ```
   - Test routing between clusters
   - Document firewall rules
   - Measure latency

3. **Standardize Infrastructure Versions**
   - Upgrade nomad-client-3 Consul to 1.21.2
   - Document version management strategy

### Phase 1 Preparation

1. **Consul Service Framework**
   - Create consul_service role as planned
   - Register existing infrastructure services
   - Implement health checks

2. **Storage Strategy**
   - Define Nomad volume specifications
   - Test persistent volume claims
   - Plan backup locations

3. **Secret Management**
   - Complete Infisical folder structure
   - Document secret paths
   - Test failover procedures

### Phase 2-3 Considerations

1. **PowerDNS Deployment**
   - Use Nomad constraint for dedicated nodes
   - Plan for 2-3 instances for HA
   - Pre-stage MariaDB deployment

2. **NetBox Requirements**
   - Allocate dedicated PostgreSQL instance
   - Plan Redis deployment
   - Reserve 40GB+ storage for growth

## Rollback Considerations

### Phase 0 (Current)
- No changes to revert (read-only assessment)
- Maintain comprehensive backups of current state

### Phase 1 Rollback Plan
- Keep Pi-hole operational throughout
- Consul DNS as addition, not replacement
- Service registrations can be removed via API

### Phase 2+ Rollback Strategy
- Maintain parallel DNS infrastructure
- Use short TTLs during transition
- Document each configuration change
- Test rollback procedures before cutover

## Success Metrics

### Phase 0 Completion Criteria
- [x] Consul health assessment complete
- [x] Infrastructure capacity verified
- [ ] DNS/IPAM audit fully documented
- [ ] Network connectivity mapped
- [ ] Security posture evaluated
- [ ] All risks documented with mitigation plans

### Overall Project Success Indicators
- DNS query success rate: >99.99%
- Service discovery latency: <10ms
- Zero unplanned outages during migration
- All services registered in Consul
- NetBox as authoritative IPAM source

## Next Steps

1. Execute missing assessment playbooks
2. Address high-priority risks
3. Create detailed Phase 1 implementation plan
4. Schedule stakeholder review meeting
5. Begin Consul service registration framework
