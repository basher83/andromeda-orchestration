# Security Posture Evaluation Report

Date: 2025-07-26
Assessment Type: DNS/IPAM Implementation Security Review
Assessor: infrastructure-assessment-analyst

## Executive Summary

**Overall Security Score: 6.5/10**

The infrastructure demonstrates good foundational security practices with encrypted communications and centralized secret management. However, several areas require attention before production deployment, particularly around secret organization, certificate management, and audit logging.

## Current Security Controls

### 1. Secret Management

**Implemented Controls:**
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- ✅ Dual secret management systems (1Password + Infisical)
- ✅ Environment variable injection for authentication
- ✅ Machine identity authentication for Infisical

**Gaps Identified:**
- ❌ Unorganized secret structure (/apollo-13/ path)
- ❌ No documented secret rotation policy
- ❌ Mixed authentication methods across playbooks
- ❌ No secret access audit logging visible

**Risk Level:** Medium

**Recommendations:**
```yaml
# Proposed Infisical folder structure
/infrastructure/
  /proxmox/
    - og-homelab-api-token
    - doggos-homelab-api-token
  /consul/
    - acl-bootstrap-token
    - agent-tokens/
  /nomad/
    - management-token
    - client-tokens/
  /dns/
    - powerdns-api-key
    - zone-transfer-keys
  /databases/
    - postgresql-admin
    - mariadb-root
```

### 2. Network Security

**Implemented Controls:**
- ✅ Consul encryption enabled (serf_lan encrypted = true)
- ✅ Consul ACLs enabled
- ✅ Private network segments (192.168.10.x, 192.168.11.x)

**Gaps Identified:**
- ❌ Inter-cluster communication security not documented
- ❌ No network segmentation for services
- ❌ DNS traffic unencrypted (port 53)
- ❌ No documented firewall rules

**Risk Level:** Medium-High

**Required Actions:**
1. Implement DNS over TLS (DoT) or DNS over HTTPS (DoH)
2. Document and test firewall rules between clusters
3. Plan network segmentation for:
   - Management plane (Consul/Nomad)
   - Data plane (PowerDNS/NetBox)
   - Storage plane (Databases)

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

**Consul Security:**
```yaml
Status: Partially Secured
- ACLs: Enabled ✅
- Default Policy: Not documented ❓
- Token Management: Via 1Password ✅
- Token Rotation: Not implemented ❌
```

**Nomad Security:**
```yaml
Status: Unknown
- ACLs: Not verified ❓
- mTLS: Not confirmed ❓
- Vault Integration: Not present ❌
```

**Risk Level:** High

**Required Configuration:**
```hcl
# Nomad ACL configuration needed
acl {
  enabled = true
  token_ttl = "30m"
  policy_ttl = "30m"
}

# Consul default ACL policy
acl {
  default_policy = "deny"
  enable_token_persistence = true
}
```

### 4. Certificate Management

**Current State:**
- ❌ No certificate management solution
- ❌ No TLS for internal services
- ❌ No certificate rotation process
- ❌ Self-signed certificates in use (Proxmox)

**Risk Level:** High

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Deploy cert-manager in Nomad
2. Configure Let's Encrypt for public endpoints
3. Implement internal CA for service-to-service
4. Automate certificate rotation

### 5. Audit & Compliance

**Audit Capabilities:**
- ❌ No centralized logging
- ❌ No audit trail for configuration changes
- ❌ No security event monitoring
- ❌ No compliance reporting

**Risk Level:** Medium

**Required Components:**
```yaml
logging_infrastructure:
  - component: Loki
    purpose: Log aggregation
  - component: Promtail
    purpose: Log shipping
  - component: Grafana
    purpose: Log visualization
  
audit_requirements:
  - dns_queries: true
  - configuration_changes: true
  - authentication_events: true
  - api_access: true
```

## Security Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 0: Assessment & Planning (Current)

## Threat Model

### High-Risk Threats

1. **DNS Cache Poisoning**
   - Mitigation: DNSSEC implementation
   - Status: Not planned ⚠️

2. **Unauthorized IPAM Changes**
   - Mitigation: NetBox RBAC + audit logging
   - Status: Planned ✅

3. **Secret Exposure**
   - Mitigation: Encrypted storage + rotation
   - Status: Partially implemented ⚠️

4. **Service Disruption**
   - Mitigation: HA deployment + monitoring
   - Status: Planned ✅

### Attack Surface Analysis

```yaml
external_exposure:
  - service: DNS
    ports: [53, 8600]
    risk: Medium
    mitigation: Rate limiting + ACLs
  
  - service: NetBox UI
    ports: [443]
    risk: Medium
    mitigation: WAF + strong auth

internal_exposure:
  - service: Consul API
    ports: [8500]
    risk: High
    mitigation: mTLS + ACLs
  
  - service: Nomad API
    ports: [4646]
    risk: High
    mitigation: mTLS + ACLs
```

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- Personal data in IPAM: IP assignments may contain user information
- Retention policy: Not defined
- Access controls: Planned via NetBox RBAC

### Security Standards
- CIS Benchmarks: Not applied
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Partial alignment
- Zero Trust Architecture: Not implemented

## Security Testing Plan

### Pre-Production Tests
1. **Secret Rotation Test**
   - Rotate all secrets
   - Verify service continuity
   - Document procedure

2. **Failure Injection**
   - Kill Consul leader
   - Disconnect cluster node
   - Exhaust resources

3. **Security Scan**
   - Port scanning
   - Vulnerability assessment
   - Configuration audit

### Ongoing Security Monitoring
```yaml
monitoring_checklist:
  daily:
    - Failed authentication attempts
    - Unusual DNS query patterns
    - Certificate expiration warnings
  
  weekly:
    - Security patch availability
    - Access control review
    - Backup verification
  
  monthly:
    - Full security audit
    - Incident response drill
    - Compliance check
```

## Recommendations Priority

### Critical (Implement before Phase 1)
1. Document and test inter-cluster security
2. Implement Nomad ACLs
3. Create secret rotation procedures
4. Deploy basic audit logging

### High (Implement during Phase 1-2)
