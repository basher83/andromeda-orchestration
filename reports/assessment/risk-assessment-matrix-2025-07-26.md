## Risk Scoring Methodology

**Probability Scale:**

- 1 = Very Low (< 10% chance)
- 2 = Low (10-30% chance)
- 3 = Medium (30-60% chance)
- 4 = High (60-90% chance)
- 5 = Very High (> 90% chance)

**Impact Scale:**

- 1 = Minimal (< 1 hour downtime, no data loss)
- 2 = Low (1-4 hours downtime, minimal data loss)
- 3 = Medium (4-8 hours downtime, recoverable data loss)
- 4 = High (8-24 hours downtime, significant data loss)
- 5 = Critical (> 24 hours downtime, permanent data loss)

**Risk Score = Probability Ã— Impact**

## Critical Risk Details

### R001: DNS Service Disruption

**Detailed Description:** During DNS cutover from Pi-hole to PowerDNS, services may experience resolution failures
**Warning Signs:**

- Increased DNS query failures
- Service discovery timeouts
- Application connection errors

**Mitigation Steps:**

1. Lower DNS TTLs to 60 seconds before cutover
2. Configure PowerDNS as upstream for Pi-hole first
3. Monitor query success rates continuously
4. Prepare instant rollback procedure

### R003: Incomplete DNS Zone Documentation

**Detailed Description:** Current DNS configuration may have undocumented zones, custom records, or dependencies
**Warning Signs:**

- Unexpected DNS records in Pi-hole
- Services failing after migration
- Missing reverse DNS entries

**Mitigation Steps:**

1. Export all Pi-hole custom entries
2. Analyze DNS query logs for 30 days
3. Document all forward and reverse zones
4. Create comprehensive zone mapping

### R004: Secret Management Transition

**Detailed Description:** Moving from 1Password to Infisical may cause authentication failures
**Warning Signs:**

- Ansible playbook authentication errors
- Service connection failures
- API access denied

**Mitigation Steps:**

1. Maintain both systems during transition
2. Test each service individually
3. Document all secret paths
4. Implement gradual migration

### R005: Inter-cluster Network Connectivity

**Detailed Description:** og-homelab and doggos-homelab connectivity requirements not fully documented
**Warning Signs:**

- Cross-cluster service failures
- Asymmetric routing issues
- Firewall blocks

**Mitigation Steps:**

1. Create network topology diagram
2. Test all required ports between clusters
3. Document firewall rules
4. Implement monitoring for network paths

### R008: Storage Persistence

**Detailed Description:** Stateful services (NetBox, PowerDNS, databases) require persistent storage
**Warning Signs:**

- Data loss on container restart
- Database corruption
- Configuration resets

**Mitigation Steps:**

1. Configure Nomad host volumes
2. Test backup and restore procedures
3. Implement regular snapshots
4. Document storage requirements

## Risk Monitoring Plan

### Daily Checks (During Implementation)

- DNS query success rate
- Service health in Consul
- Storage utilization
- Network connectivity tests

### Weekly Reviews

- Risk score reassessment
- Mitigation effectiveness
- New risk identification
- Stakeholder communication

### Phase Gates

Before proceeding to next phase, verify:

- All high risks (score > 10) have active mitigation
- No critical issues in previous phase
- Rollback procedures tested
- Stakeholder approval obtained

## Contingency Plans

### Scenario 1: Complete DNS Failure

**Trigger:** DNS resolution fails for > 50% of queries
**Response:**

1. Immediate rollback to Pi-hole
2. Analyze failure root cause
3. Implement fixes in staging
4. Retry with improved plan

### Scenario 2: Data Corruption

**Trigger:** IPAM data inconsistency detected
**Response:**

1. Stop all write operations
2. Restore from last known good backup
3. Validate data integrity
4. Resume with additional checks

### Scenario 3: Security Breach

**Trigger:** Unauthorized access detected
**Response:**

1. Rotate all credentials immediately
2. Audit access logs
3. Implement additional controls
4. Security review before continuing

## Risk Communication Matrix

| Stakeholder | Communication Method | Frequency | Escalation Threshold |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Infrastructure Team | Slack + Email | Daily | Any risk > 10 |
| Management | Email Summary | Weekly | Any risk > 12 |
| Security Team | Direct Message | As needed | Security risks > 6 |
| End Users | Status Page | Major changes | Service impact expected |

## Success Criteria

Risk management successful when:

- No risks materialize into incidents
- All high risks reduced to medium or lower
- Rollback never required (but always ready)
- Zero unplanned downtime
- Full documentation maintained
