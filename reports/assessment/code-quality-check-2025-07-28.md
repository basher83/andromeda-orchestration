# Code Quality Check Report

Generated: 2025-07-28

## Summary

Conducted comprehensive linting, testing, and security checks on the NetBox-Ansible codebase using the Taskfile.yml automation.

## Results

### 1. YAML Linting (`task lint:yaml`)

**Status**: ⚠️ Warnings Present

**Issues Found**:
- Line length warnings (>120 characters) in several playbooks
- Syntax error in `nomad-client-3-mable.yml` - **FIXED**
- Truthy value warning in GitHub workflow - **FIXED**
- Trailing spaces in multiple files - **FIXED**
- Missing newlines at end of files - **FIXED**
- Indentation errors in generated report files (not critical)

**Remaining Warnings**:
- Line length warnings fixed ✅
- Report files have indentation issues (generated files, can be ignored)

### 2. Ansible Linting (`task lint:ansible`)

**Status**: ⚠️ Minor Issues

**Issues Found**:
- Jinja spacing suggestions
- FQCN recommendations for builtin modules
- File permissions warnings
- Handler usage suggestions

**Note**: Most issues are best practices recommendations, not errors.

### 3. Python Linting (`task lint:python`)

**Status**: ✅ Passed

**Result**: All Python code passes ruff checks successfully.

### 4. Testing (`task test`)

**Status**: ✅ All Tests Pass

**Test Results**:
- **Syntax Check**: All 13 playbooks pass syntax validation
- **Python Tests**: No Python tests found (as expected)

**Note**: Deprecation warning about `DEFAULT_UNDEFINED_VAR_BEHAVIOR` in Ansible 2.23 (informational only).

### 5. Security Scanning (`task security`)

#### Infisical Secrets Scan
**Status**: ✅ Passed
- 41 commits scanned
- No secrets or leaks found

#### KICS Infrastructure Scan
**Status**: ⚠️ Passed with Findings
- Scan completed successfully 
- Files scanned: 28
- Queries executed: 303
- Findings:
  - **MEDIUM severity**: 11 issues
    - 7x Dockerfile apt packages without pinned versions (molecule test container)
    - 4x Ansible playbooks using HTTP instead of HTTPS for Consul API
  - **INFO severity**: 1 issue
    - Missing file permissions in ansible.builtin.copy task
  - **No HIGH or CRITICAL issues found**

## Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed syntax error** in `inventory/doggos-homelab/host_vars/nomad-client-3-mable.yml`
2. **Removed trailing spaces** from all YAML files
3. **Added missing newlines** at end of files
4. **Fixed truthy warning** in GitHub workflow by quoting 'on'
5. **Updated kics.config** to remove invalid YAML platform type
6. **Fixed all line length warnings** in playbooks for better readability

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Consider using HTTPS for Consul API communication (4 MEDIUM issues)
   - Acceptable for development/staging environment
   - Should be addressed before production deployment

### Medium Priority
1. Update playbooks to use FQCN for builtin modules
2. Add file permissions where flagged by ansible-lint
3. Consider pinning package versions in Molecule Dockerfile

### Low Priority
1. Address Ansible deprecation warning when upgrading to 2.23
2. Consider adding Python tests for custom plugins

## Conclusion

The codebase is in good shape with only minor linting warnings and no critical security issues. All syntax errors have been resolved. The project follows good security practices with no secrets exposed. The KICS scan revealed some medium-severity issues related to HTTP usage in Consul communication that should be addressed for production deployments.
