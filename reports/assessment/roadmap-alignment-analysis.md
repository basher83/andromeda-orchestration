# ROADMAP.md vs Project Task List Alignment Analysis

Generated: 2025-07-28

## Overview

This analysis compares the high-level ROADMAP.md with the detailed project-task-list.md to ensure proper alignment and appropriate level of detail in each document.

## Document Purposes

### ROADMAP.md
- **Purpose**: High-level strategic overview of the DNS/IPAM overhaul
- **Audience**: Stakeholders, architects, team leads
- **Scope**: 5 phases with major milestones
- **Detail Level**: Strategic objectives and outcomes

### project-task-list.md
- **Purpose**: Detailed task tracking and project management
- **Audience**: Implementation team, project managers
- **Scope**: 23 granular tasks with status tracking
- **Detail Level**: Tactical execution with specific action items

## Alignment Analysis

### Phase Mapping

| ROADMAP Phase | Project Task List Coverage | Alignment Status |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **Phase 1: Cement Consul Foundation** | - Task 1: Infrastructure Assessment<br>- Task 5: Development Environment<br>- Task 7: Service Templates | ✅ Aligned |
| **Phase 2: Deploy PowerDNS into Nomad** | - Task 8: Monitoring Strategy<br>- Task 9: Migration Runbooks<br>- Task 18: Integration Testing | ✅ Aligned |
| **Phase 3: Hook up NetBox → PowerDNS** | - Task 6: IP Address Schema<br>- Task 12: Automation Workflows | ✅ Aligned |
| **Phase 4: Phase Out Pi-hole** | - Task 3: Document Current State<br>- Task 4: Backup Procedures | ✅ Aligned |
| **Phase 5: Scale, Harden & Automate** | - Task 15: Security Hardening<br>- Task 16: Performance Optimization<br>- Task 21: Automated Backups | ✅ Aligned |

### Key Findings

#### ✅ Strengths

1. **Consistent Vision**: Both documents share the same end goal of service-aware DNS/IPAM infrastructure
2. **Phase Alignment**: All 5 ROADMAP phases have corresponding tasks in the project list
3. **Appropriate Detail Levels**: ROADMAP maintains strategic view while task list provides tactical details
4. **Clear Outcomes**: ROADMAP focuses on deliverables, task list focuses on activities

#### ⚠️ Minor Gaps

1. **ROADMAP Bootstrap Tip**: The Phase 3 bootstrap tip about starting with minimal NetBox data isn't reflected in the task list
2. **TLS/SSL Management**: Phase 5 includes specific SSL strategies (DNS-01 ACME, Vault PKI) not detailed in tasks
3. **Assessment Status**: Task list shows assessment tasks as completed (checked), but ROADMAP doesn't reflect current state

## Recommendations

### 1. Update ROADMAP.md to Reflect Current State

Add a status indicator to show Phase 0 (assessment) is complete:

```markdown
## Current Status: Phase 0 Complete ✅

- Infrastructure assessments completed
- Current state documented
- Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation
```

### 2. Add Bootstrap Task to Project List

Add a new medium-priority task:

```markdown
#### X. Bootstrap NetBox with Essential Records

**Description**: Seed NetBox with critical DNS records to enable early PowerDNS sync
**Status**: Not Started
**Blockers**: NetBox deployment required
**Related**: Phase 3 bootstrap strategy

Tasks:
- [ ] Identify critical DNS records (proxmox hosts, core services)
- [ ] Create minimal NetBox data model
- [ ] Test PowerDNS sync with limited dataset
- [ ] Plan incremental data migration
```

### 3. Enhance TLS/SSL Task Detail

Update Task 15 (Security Hardening) to include:
- DNS-01 ACME challenge setup
- Vault PKI integration planning
- Consul Connect mTLS configuration

### 4. Keep ROADMAP High-Level

The ROADMAP correctly maintains its strategic focus. Resist adding tactical details that belong in the task list.

## Conclusion

The ROADMAP.md and project-task-list.md are **well-aligned** with appropriate separation of concerns:

- **ROADMAP.md**: Provides the "why" and "what" at a strategic level
- **project-task-list.md**: Provides the "how" and "when" at a tactical level

The documents complement each other effectively, with only minor adjustments needed to reflect current project state and ensure all strategic initiatives have corresponding tactical tasks.
