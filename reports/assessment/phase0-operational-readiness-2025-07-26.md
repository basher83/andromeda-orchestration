```

**Tests to Perform:**
- [ ] Inter-cluster routing verification
- [ ] Latency measurements
- [ ] Bandwidth tests
- [ ] Firewall rule documentation
- [ ] Port availability scan

### Week 2: Analysis and Planning

#### Day 6-7: Data Analysis

- [ ] Document all DNS zones and records
- [ ] Map IP allocation patterns
- [ ] Identify service dependencies

#### Day 8-9: Gap Analysis
- [ ] Compare current state to target architecture
- [ ] Identify missing components
- [ ] Document technical debt
- [ ] Create remediation plan

#### Day 10: Stakeholder Review
- [ ] Prepare executive summary
- [ ] Schedule review meeting
- [ ] Gather feedback
- [ ] Update implementation plan

## Risk Mitigation

### Assessment Risks
1. **Incomplete Discovery**
   - Mitigation: Multiple assessment runs
   - Validation: Cross-reference multiple sources

2. **Service Impact**
   - Mitigation: Read-only operations
   - Validation: Monitor service health

3. **Access Issues**
   - Mitigation: Test credentials early
   - Validation: Have fallback access methods

## Next Steps

After Phase 0 completion:
1. Review all findings with team
2. Update implementation timeline
3. Create detailed Phase 1 plan
4. Order any required hardware/licenses
5. Schedule Phase 1 kick-off
