# Reports Directory

This directory contains all generated reports from the NetBox-Ansible project, organized by type and purpose.

⚠️ **SECURITY NOTICE**: Reports may contain sensitive infrastructure data. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for handling procedures.

**Important**: Raw reports (`.yml`, `.json`, `.txt`) are automatically excluded from git. Only commit sanitized markdown summaries.

## Directory Structure

## Report Types

### Assessment Reports (`/assessment/`)

Strategic evaluations and quality checks:

- Infrastructure readiness assessments
- Security posture evaluations
- Code quality checks
- Risk assessment matrices
- Project alignment analyses

**When to use**: For comprehensive evaluations, gap analyses, and strategic planning.

### Operational Reports (`/{service}/`)

Service-specific runtime data:

- **Consul**: Service discovery health, ACL status, cluster state
- **DNS-IPAM**: DNS configuration audits, IPAM utilization
- **Infrastructure**: Resource utilization, capacity planning
- **Nomad**: Job status, allocation reports, cluster health

**When to use**: For monitoring operational state and troubleshooting.

### Test Reports (`/connectivity/`)

Network and service connectivity validation:

- Inter-node connectivity matrices
- Service endpoint availability
- DNS resolution tests

**When to use**: For validating network configuration and service mesh connectivity.

## Report Naming Conventions

### Date-Stamped Reports

Format: `{report_type}_{node/scope}_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.{ext}`

Examples:

- `consul_node_holly_2025-07-27_0031.yml`
- `infrastructure_readiness_2025-07-24_0237.md`

### Analysis Reports

Format: `{topic}-{type}.md`

Examples:

- `roadmap-alignment-analysis.md`
- `playbook-fixes-implementation-status.md`

## File Formats

- **`.yml`**: Structured data exports (Ansible facts, service states)
- **`.md`**: Human-readable reports with analysis and recommendations
- **`.json`**: API responses and structured query results

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Generation**: Reports are generated by assessment playbooks in `/playbooks/assessment/`
2. **Retention**: Keep operational reports for 30 days, assessment reports indefinitely
3. **Automation**: Use ansible-playbook with appropriate inventory to generate reports
4. **Review**: Assessment reports should be reviewed before making infrastructure changes

## Generating Reports

### Infrastructure Assessment

```bash
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/assessment/infrastructure-readiness.yml \
  -i inventory/og-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml
```

### DNS/IPAM Audit

```bash
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/assessment/dns-ipam-audit.yml \
  -i inventory/og-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml
```

### Consul Health Check

```bash
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/assessment/consul-health-check.yml \
  -i inventory/doggos-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml
```

## Report Consumers

- **DevOps Team**: Operational reports for monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Security Team**: Security posture and compliance reports
- **Architecture Team**: Assessment reports for planning and design
- **Management**: Executive summaries and risk assessments

## Integration Points

- **NetBox**: Reports inform NetBox data population
- **Monitoring**: Operational reports feed into monitoring dashboards
- **CI/CD**: Code quality reports gate deployments
- **Documentation**: Assessment findings update project documentation
