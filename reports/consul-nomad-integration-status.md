# Consul-Nomad Integration Status Report

**Date**: 2025-07-29  
**Cluster**: doggos-homelab

## Summary

The Consul-Nomad integration configuration has been applied, but services are not registering due to Consul ACL requirements.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. SSH connectivity resolved using staging key from ~/keys/
2. Nomad configuration updated with Consul integration stanza on all nodes
3. Configuration includes all necessary parameters:
   - `auto_advertise = true`
   - `server_auto_join = true`
   - `client_auto_join = true`
   - Service names configured
4. Nomad services restarted successfully

### ❌ Issues Found
1. **Consul ACLs Enabled**: Consul requires authentication tokens
   - Error: "anonymous token lacks permission 'agent:read'"
   - Nomad cannot register services without proper ACL token
2. **nomad-client-3-mable**: Consul service not running on this node
3. **No services registered**: Due to missing ACL configuration

## Network Configuration
- Nomad cluster communication: 192.168.11.x (10G network)
- Consul API: 127.0.0.1:8500 (localhost)
- Both services are running but not integrated

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Consul ACL tokens for Nomad**:
   ```hcl
   # In Nomad configuration
   consul {
     token = "YOUR-CONSUL-TOKEN-HERE"
     # ... existing configuration
   }
   ```

2. **Fix Consul on nomad-client-3-mable**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start consul
   sudo systemctl enable consul
   ```

3. **Create appropriate Consul policies** for Nomad:
   - Service registration permissions
   - Node read/write permissions
   - Service discovery permissions

4. **Verify integration** after ACL configuration:
   ```bash
   consul catalog services | grep nomad
   ```

## Configuration Applied

The following configuration was added to all Nomad nodes:

```hcl
consul {
  address = "127.0.0.1:8500"
  
  # Enable service registration
  auto_advertise = true
  server_auto_join = true
  client_auto_join = true
  
  # Service names
  server_service_name = "nomad"
  client_service_name = "nomad-client"
  
  # Enable service checks
  checks_use_advertise = true
  
  # Keep existing identity settings
  service_identity {
    enabled = true
    auto    = true
  }
  
  task_identity {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```

## Recommendations

1. Check if Consul ACL tokens are stored in Infisical under `/consul/tokens/`
2. Update the Nomad configuration to include the appropriate token
3. Consider creating a dedicated Consul policy for Nomad integration
4. Document the ACL token management process

The infrastructure is ready for integration, but requires ACL configuration to complete the setup.
