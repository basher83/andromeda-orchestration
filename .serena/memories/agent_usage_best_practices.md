# Agent Usage Best Practices

When working on tasks in this project, follow these critical guidelines:

## 1. Always Check for Specialized Agents First
Before starting any task, review available agents to see if one matches the work:
- **docs-agent**: Documentation updates, markdown fixes, doc organization
- **netbox-integration-engineer**: NetBox modules, lookups, source-of-truth patterns
- **ansible-playbook-developer**: Creating/testing playbooks, especially for NetBox/DNS/IPAM
- **task-master**: Project management, task tracking, priority evaluation
- **git-commit-organizer**: Creating clean commits from workspace changes
- **infrastructure-assessment-analyst**: Pre-implementation assessments and audits

## 2. Use Specialized Agents Proactively
Don't wait to be asked - if a task matches an agent's description, use it immediately. The agents are designed to handle specific domains more effectively than general-purpose approaches.

## 3. Avoid Defaulting to Direct Implementation
Resist the urge to jump straight into implementation. Take a moment to:
- Consider which agent best fits the task
- Use the agent's specialized knowledge and patterns
- Let agents handle their domains of expertise

This approach ensures better quality, consistency, and adherence to project patterns.
