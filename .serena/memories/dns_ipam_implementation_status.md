# DNS & IPAM Implementation Status

## Current Focus

Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation after completing comprehensive infrastructure assessments.

## Phase 0 Progress (✅ COMPLETED)

### Assessment Playbooks Created

- `playbooks/assessment/consul-health-check.yml` - Consul cluster health evaluation
- `playbooks/assessment/consul-detailed-check.yml` - Detailed Consul assessment with ACL token
- `playbooks/assessment/nomad-cluster-check.yml` - Nomad cluster assessment
- `playbooks/assessment/infrastructure-readiness.yml` - Resource availability checks

### Assessment Results

- **Consul**: v1.21.2, healthy 6-node cluster (3 servers, 3 clients), ACLs enabled
- **Nomad**: v1.10.2, healthy cluster, ACLs disabled, Docker available
- **Resources**: Each node has 4 CPUs, 16GB RAM, 50+ GB disk
- **Network**: Dual-network setup (management: 192.168.10.x, internal: 192.168.11.x)

### Infrastructure Ready

- ✅ Consul ACL token stored in 1Password as "Consul ACL - doggos-homelab"
- ✅ Fixed inventory ansible_host resolution using proxmox_ipconfig0
- ✅ Created Nomad job deployment playbooks
- ✅ Built service registration framework
- ✅ Created PowerDNS Nomad job specification

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 0: Infrastructure Assessment** ✅ COMPLETED
   - All assessments complete
   - Infrastructure verified ready

2. **Phase 1: Consul Foundation** (READY TO START)
   - ✅ Service registration playbooks created
   - ✅ Consul DNS verified on port 8600
   - TODO: Configure system DNS forwarding
   - TODO: Create backup procedures

3. **Phase 2: PowerDNS Deployment** (READY)
   - ✅ Nomad job spec created: `jobs/powerdns.nomad`
   - ✅ Deployment playbooks ready
   - TODO: Deploy and test

4. **Phase 3: NetBox Integration**
   - Deploy NetBox stack
   - Migrate IPAM data
   - PowerDNS sync

5. **Phase 4: DNS Cutover**
   - Gradual migration
   - Validation
   - Cleanup

6. **Phase 5: Production Hardening**
   - High availability
   - Security (DNSSEC)
   - Monitoring

## Key Files Added

- Consul integration: `playbooks/examples/consul-with-1password.yml`
- Nomad management: `playbooks/nomad/`
- Service registration: `playbooks/consul/service-register-v2.yml`
- PowerDNS job: `jobs/powerdns.nomad`
- Documentation: `docs/consul-1password-setup.md`

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Deploy PowerDNS using: `ansible-playbook playbooks/nomad/job-deploy.yml -e job_path=jobs/powerdns.nomad`
2. Configure DNS forwarding for .consul domain
3. Test service discovery with PowerDNS
