PowerDNS Secrets Playbook [create-powerdns-secrets.yml](./create-powerdns-secrets.yml):

1. âœ… Removed hard-coded credentials - Now uses ansible_env.VAULT_TOKEN and ansible_env.VAULT_ADDR
2. âœ… Fixed password generation - Uses /dev/null instead of temp files to avoid leaving secrets on disk
3. âœ… Fixed character set - Uses proper hexdigits for API key (no redundancy)
4. âœ… Added environment validation - Fails early with helpful message if direnv isn't loaded
5. âœ… Added connectivity test - Checks Vault health before attempting operations
6. âœ… Better variable organization - Grouped secrets under secrets dictionary
7. âœ… Added cleanup handler - Removes any temp files if they exist
8. âœ… Enhanced feedback - Shows masked token and environment status

Manage Secrets Playbook [manage-secrets.yml](./manage-secrets.yml):
