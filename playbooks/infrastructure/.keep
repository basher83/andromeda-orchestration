# Infrastructure Playbooks

This directory will contain production playbooks for managing infrastructure components.

## Planned playbooks:

### Network Management
- `configure-switches.yml` - Configure network switches from NetBox data
- `configure-routers.yml` - Configure routers based on NetBox inventory
- `backup-network-configs.yml` - Backup network device configurations

### VM/Container Management
- `provision-vms.yml` - Create VMs in Proxmox based on NetBox requirements
- `configure-containers.yml` - Deploy and configure LXC containers
- `manage-vm-lifecycle.yml` - Start/stop/restart VMs based on NetBox data

### NetBox Synchronization
- `sync-proxmox-to-netbox.yml` - Update NetBox with Proxmox VM information
- `sync-network-devices.yml` - Update NetBox with discovered network devices

### Site Operations
- `site.yml` - Main playbook that orchestrates other playbooks
- `update-infrastructure.yml` - Apply updates across infrastructure

## Usage

All playbooks should follow the pattern of using NetBox as the source of truth
and leveraging the 1Password integration for credential management.
