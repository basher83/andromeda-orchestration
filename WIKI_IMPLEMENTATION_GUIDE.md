# Wiki Implementation Guide

This guide provides practical steps for implementing the proposed wiki structure for the Andromeda Orchestration repository.

## Executive Summary

The Andromeda Orchestration project has comprehensive documentation across 80+ files in a well-organized structure. The proposed wiki will make this valuable content more accessible through:

- **Role-based navigation** for different user types (operators, developers, DevOps engineers)
- **Current status dashboard** highlighting the DNS & IPAM implementation progress (Phase 3 of 5)
- **Progressive content organization** from getting started to deep technical implementation
- **Enhanced discoverability** through improved navigation and cross-referencing

## Recommended Implementation Approach

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal: Create essential navigation and high-impact pages**

#### Priority Pages to Create:

1. **Wiki Home Page**
   - Project overview with current DNS & IPAM status
   - Role-based quick navigation (3 user types)
   - Key infrastructure highlights (Consul, Nomad, Vault, NetBox)
   - Link to Phase 3 implementation progress

2. **Getting Started Hub**
   - Quick start guide (setup script â†’ first command)
   - Environment configuration (uv, Infisical, dependencies)
   - First success path (inventory test)
   - Common troubleshooting (macOS permissions, Infisical issues)

3. **DNS & IPAM Implementation Center**
   - Current status: Phase 3 in progress
   - Implementation plan overview (5 phases)
   - Next steps and completion criteria
   - NetBox integration patterns

4. **Operations Quick Reference**
   - Daily operational commands
   - Cluster status and access
   - Common playbook usage
   - Emergency procedures

#### Success Metrics:
- New users can get from clone to first successful command in < 15 minutes
- Current implementers can quickly find Phase 3 guidance
- Operators can access daily procedures without deep navigation

### ðŸ”§ Phase 2: Technical Depth (Week 2)
**Goal: Migrate comprehensive technical documentation**

#### Content Migration Priorities:

1. **Complete Implementation Guides**
   - All DNS & IPAM documentation (`docs/implementation/dns-ipam/`)
   - Secrets management guides (`docs/implementation/infisical/`)
   - HashiCorp stack documentation (Consul, Vault, Nomad)
   - NetBox integration patterns and examples

2. **Standards & Reference**
   - Development standards (`docs/standards/`)
   - Architecture diagrams (`docs/diagrams/`)

   - Role documentation (all role READMEs)

3. **Operations Documentation**
   - Complete troubleshooting guides (`docs/troubleshooting/`)
   - Monitoring and observability (`docs/operations/netdata/`)
   - Security procedures (`docs/operations/security-scanning.md`)
   - Backup and recovery procedures

#### Success Metrics:
- Technical implementers can find detailed guidance for any component
- Developers have clear standards and contribution guidelines
- Operations team has comprehensive procedural documentation

### ðŸŒŸ Phase 3: Enhancement (Week 3)
**Goal: Add community features and advanced navigation**

#### Advanced Features:

1. **Interactive Navigation**
   - Status dashboards with progress indicators
   - Context-sensitive quick links
   - Search enhancement with tagging
   - Cross-reference automation

2. **Community Integration**
   - Contribution guidelines
   - AI assistant integration documentation
   - Project management tracking
   - Learning resources and tutorials

3. **Maintenance Automation**
   - Content freshness monitoring
   - Broken link detection
   - Synchronization with repository documentation
   - Community contribution workflows

## Specific Implementation Steps

### Setting Up GitHub Wiki

1. **Enable Wiki in Repository Settings**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to repository settings â†’ Features â†’ Wikis (enable)
   ```

2. **Create Initial Page Structure**
   ```
   Home
   â”œâ”€â”€ Getting-Started
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Quick-Start-Guide
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Development-Environment
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Troubleshooting
   â”œâ”€â”€ Implementation-Guides
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DNS-IPAM-Overhaul
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Secrets-Management
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ HashiCorp-Stack
   â”œâ”€â”€ Operations
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Daily-Procedures
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cluster-Management
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Emergency-Response
   â””â”€â”€ Reference
       â”œâ”€â”€ Standards
       â”œâ”€â”€ Architecture
       â””â”€â”€ API-Documentation
   ```

3. **Content Migration Process**
   ```bash
   # For each priority document:
   # 1. Extract relevant content
   # 2. Adapt for wiki format (add navigation, cross-links)
   # 3. Create in wiki with proper linking
   # 4. Add to navigation structure
   ```

### Content Adaptation Guidelines

#### From Repository Docs to Wiki Format

**Before (Repository):**
```markdown
# Implementation Plan
This document outlines...
```

**After (Wiki):**
```markdown
# DNS & IPAM Implementation Plan

**Quick Navigation:** [Home](Home) | [Getting Started](Getting-Started) | [Operations](Operations)

**Current Status:** Phase 3 - NetBox Integration (In Progress)

## Overview
This guide outlines the comprehensive plan for transitioning...

## Prerequisites
- Access to infrastructure clusters
- Infisical environment configured
- Basic Ansible knowledge
