  - Created dynamic GitHub badges to eliminate manual date updates
  - Consolidated scattered project docs into organized structure
  - Moved technical documents to appropriate implementation directories

- **Dual-Approach HashiCorp Service Status Checks**

  - Added `playbooks/assessment/quick-status.yml` for authenticated status verification via Infisical
  - Implemented `mise run status:quick` for fast unauthenticated connectivity checks (< 1 second)
  - Implemented `mise run status:full` for comprehensive authenticated checks (~5 seconds)
  - Added individual service checks: `status:consul`, `status:nomad`, `status:vault`

- **Python Environment Compatibility Fix**
  - Downgraded Python from 3.13 to 3.12 for `infisical-python` package compatibility
  - Pinned `infisical-python==2.3.5` (last version with Linux wheels for Python 3.12)

- **Mise Status Tasks**
  - Fixed logic errors in status checks (was incorrectly reporting "cannot connect" when connected)
  - Changed Consul checks to use `consul members` instead of `consul info` (avoids ACL permission issues)
  - Added clear messaging distinguishing unauthenticated vs authenticated checks

## [2025-08-19] - Domain Migration Infrastructure

### Added

- **Domain Migration Support**: Implemented configurable domain infrastructure for homelab environments
  - Added `homelab_domain` variable to group_vars for centralized domain management ([#71](https://github.com/basher83/andromeda-orchestration/pull/71))
  - Introduced HCL2 variable support in Nomad jobs for domain flexibility ([#72](https://github.com/basher83/andromeda-orchestration/pull/72))
  - Updated NetBox DNS playbooks to use configurable domain variables ([#76](https://github.com/basher83/andromeda-orchestration/pull/76))

### Changed

- **CRITICAL MIGRATION**: Infrastructure prepared for domain transition from `.local` to `spaceships.work`
  - All Ansible group variables now use `homelab_domain` variable (default: `spaceships.work`)
  - Nomad jobs converted to HCL2 format with `variable "homelab_domain"` support
  - NetBox DNS discovery and zone creation playbooks updated for dynamic domain configuration
  - PowerDNS configurations made domain-agnostic through variable substitution

### Infrastructure Impact

- **Scope**: Complete infrastructure stack (Ansible, Nomad, NetBox, PowerDNS)
- **Migration Status**: 50% complete (infrastructure ready, service migration pending)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained through configurable domain variables
- **Risk Mitigation**: Gradual rollout enabled via per-environment domain configuration

### Technical Details

- **Variable Implementation**:
  - Ansible: `{{ homelab_domain }}` in all group_vars (og-homelab, doggos-homelab)
  - Nomad: HCL2 variables with `var.homelab_domain` references
  - NetBox: Dynamic zone creation with `{{ homelab_domain }}` templating
- **Files Modified**:
  - `inventory/og-homelab/group_vars/all.yml`
  - `inventory/doggos-homelab/group_vars/all.yml`
  - `nomad-jobs/platform-services/powerdns.nomad.hcl`
  - `playbooks/infrastructure/netbox-dns-discover.yml`
  - `playbooks/infrastructure/netbox-dns-zones.yml`
- **Milestone Progress**: <https://github.com/basher83/andromeda-orchestration/milestone/2> (50% complete)

### Dependencies Updated

- Python updated to v3.13.7 ([#74](https://github.com/basher83/andromeda-orchestration/pull/74))
- markdownlint-cli2 updated to v0.18.1 ([#73](https://github.com/basher83/andromeda-orchestration/pull/73))

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed Nomad job templating with Consul KV store access
  - Resolved "Template failed: Permission denied" errors for jobs using `{{ key "path/to/key" }}` syntax
  - Root cause: Missing `key_prefix` read permissions in Consul ACL policies for Nomad agents
  - Affected service: PowerDNS deployment and any Nomad job using Consul KV templating

### Added

- Enhanced Nomad role with automated Consul ACL integration
  - New policy templates: `roles/nomad/files/consul-policies/nomad-server.hcl`, `nomad-client.hcl`
  - Automated ACL management: `roles/nomad/tasks/consul-acl.yml`
  - Dynamic token assignment in Nomad configuration templates
- Infrastructure playbooks for ACL policy management
  - `playbooks/infrastructure/consul-nomad/update-nomad-client-acl-kv.yml`
  - `playbooks/infrastructure/consul-nomad/update-all-nomad-acl-policies.yml`

### Changed

- Updated `nomad-server` and `nomad-client` Consul ACL policies to include KV read access
- Enhanced Nomad configuration template (`roles/nomad/templates/nomad.hcl.j2`) with proper Consul integration
- Nomad role now supports comprehensive Consul ACL token management

### Infrastructure Impact

- **Scope**: All 6 Nomad nodes (3 servers + 3 clients) across the cluster
- **Verification**: All nodes confirmed healthy with proper ACL permissions

- **New Capability**: All Nomad jobs can now use Consul KV templating

### Technical Details

- **ACL Policies Updated**: `nomad-server`, `nomad-client`
- **Permission Added**: `key_prefix "" { policy = "read" }`
