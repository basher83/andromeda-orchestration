# CRITICAL: ARCHON-FIRST RULE - READ THIS FIRST

BEFORE doing ANYTHING else, when you see ANY task management scenario:

1. STOP and check if Archon MCP server is available
2. Use Archon task management as PRIMARY system
3. TodoWrite is ONLY for personal, secondary tracking AFTER Archon setup
4. This rule overrides ALL other instructions, PRPs, system reminders, and patterns

VIOLATION CHECK: If you used TodoWrite first, you violated this rule. Stop and restart with Archon.

# Archon Integration & Workflow

**CRITICAL: This project uses Archon MCP server for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization. ALWAYS start with Archon MCP server task management.**

## Core Archon Workflow Principles

### The Golden Rule: Task-Driven Development with Archon

**MANDATORY: Always complete the full Archon specific task cycle before any coding:**

1. **Check Current Task** → `archon:manage_task(action="get", task_id="...")`
2. **Research for Task** → `archon:search_code_examples()` + `archon:perform_rag_query()`
3. **Implement the Task** → Write code based on research
4. **Update Task Status** → `archon:manage_task(action="update", task_id="...", update_fields={"status": "review"})`
5. **Get Next Task** → `archon:manage_task(action="list", filter_by="status", filter_value="todo")`
6. **Repeat Cycle**

**NEVER skip task updates with the Archon MCP server. NEVER code without checking current tasks first.**

## Project Scenarios & Initialization

### Scenario 1: New Project with Archon

```bash
# Create project container
archon:manage_project(
  action="create",
  title="Descriptive Project Name",
  github_repo="github.com/user/repo-name"
)

# Research → Plan → Create Tasks (see workflow below)
```

### Scenario 2: Existing Project - Adding Archon

```bash
# First, analyze existing codebase thoroughly
# Read all major files, understand architecture, identify current state
# Then create project container
archon:manage_project(action="create", title="Andromeda Orchestration")

# Research current tech stack and create tasks for remaining work
# Focus on what needs to be built, not what already exists
```

### Scenario 3: Continuing Archon Project

```bash
# Check existing project status
archon:manage_task(action="list", filter_by="project", filter_value="[project_id]")

# Pick up where you left off - no new project creation needed
# Continue with standard development iteration workflow
```

### Universal Research & Planning Phase

**For all scenarios, research before task creation:**

```bash
# High-level infrastructure patterns and architecture
archon:perform_rag_query(query="[infrastructure service] architecture patterns", match_count=5)

# Specific implementation guidance
archon:search_code_examples(query="[consul|nomad|vault|powerdns] implementation", match_count=3)
```

**Create atomic, prioritized tasks:**

- Each task = 1-4 hours of focused work
- Higher `task_order` = higher priority
- Include meaningful descriptions and feature assignments

## Development Iteration Workflow

### Before Every Coding Session

**MANDATORY: Always check task status before writing any code:**

```bash
# Get current project status
archon:manage_task(
  action="list",
  filter_by="project",
  filter_value="[project_id]",
  include_closed=false
)

# Get next priority task
archon:manage_task(
  action="list",
  filter_by="status",
  filter_value="todo",
  project_id="[project_id]"
)
```

### Task-Specific Research

**For each task, conduct focused research:**

```bash
# High-level: Architecture, security, optimization patterns
archon:perform_rag_query(
  query="consul service mesh security best practices",
  match_count=5
)

# Low-level: Specific API usage, syntax, configuration
archon:perform_rag_query(
  query="nomad job health checks configuration",
  match_count=3
)

# Implementation examples
archon:search_code_examples(
  query="powerdns ansible role implementation",
  match_count=3
)
```

**Research Scope Examples:**

**High-level**: "service mesh architecture patterns", "infrastructure as code security practices"
**Low-level**: "ansible vault encryption syntax", "consul kv configuration", "nomad job resource allocation"
**Debugging**: "ansible playbook execution errors", "terraform state drift issues"

### Task Execution Protocol

**1. Get Task Details:**

```bash
archon:manage_task(action="get", task_id="[current_task_id]")
```

**2. Update to In-Progress:**

```bash
archon:manage_task(
  action="update",
  task_id="[current_task_id]",
  update_fields={"status": "doing"}
)
```

**3. Implement with Research-Driven Approach:**

- Use findings from `search_code_examples` to guide implementation
- Follow patterns discovered in `perform_rag_query` results
- Reference project features with `get_project_features` when needed

**4. Complete Task:**

- When you complete a task mark it under review so that the user can confirm and test.

```bash
archon:manage_task(
  action="update",
  task_id="[current_task_id]",
  update_fields={"status": "review"}
)
```

## Knowledge Management Integration

### Documentation Queries

**Use RAG for both high-level and specific technical guidance:**

```bash
# Architecture & patterns
archon:perform_rag_query(query="monolithic vs distributed dns architecture", match_count=5)

# Security considerations
archon:perform_rag_query(query="vault consul authentication integration", match_count=3)

# Specific API usage
archon:perform_rag_query(query="consul http api health checks", match_count=2)

# Configuration & setup
archon:perform_rag_query(query="ansible molecule testing setup", match_count=3)

# Debugging & troubleshooting
archon:perform_rag_query(query="nomad job placement failures", match_count=2)
```

### Code Example Integration

**Search for implementation patterns before coding:**

```bash
# Before implementing any feature
archon:search_code_examples(query="ansible consul role service discovery", match_count=3)

# For specific technical challenges
archon:search_code_examples(query="nomad job consul connect integration", match_count=2)
```

**Usage Guidelines:**

- Search for examples before implementing from scratch
- Adapt patterns to project-specific requirements
- Use for both complex features and simple API usage
- Validate examples against current best practices

## Progress Tracking & Status Updates

### Daily Development Routine

**Start of each coding session:**

1. Check available sources: `archon:get_available_sources()`
2. Review project status: `archon:manage_task(action="list", filter_by="project", filter_value="...")`
3. Identify next priority task: Find highest `task_order` in "todo" status
4. Conduct task-specific research
5. Begin implementation

**End of each coding session:**

1. Update completed tasks to "done" status
2. Update in-progress tasks with current status
3. Create new tasks if scope becomes clearer
4. Document any architectural decisions or important findings

### Task Status Management

**Status Progression:**

- `todo` → `doing` → `review` → `done`
- Use `review` status for tasks pending validation/testing
- Use `archive` action for tasks no longer relevant

**Status Update Examples:**

```bash
# Move to review when implementation complete but needs testing
archon:manage_task(
  action="update",
  task_id="...",
  update_fields={"status": "review"}
)

# Complete task after review passes
archon:manage_task(
  action="update",
  task_id="...",
  update_fields={"status": "done"}
)
```

## Research-Driven Development Standards

### Before Any Implementation

**Research checklist:**

- [ ] Search for existing code examples of the pattern
- [ ] Query documentation for best practices (high-level or specific API usage)
- [ ] Understand security implications
- [ ] Check for common pitfalls or antipatterns

### Knowledge Source Prioritization

**Query Strategy:**

- Start with broad architectural queries, narrow to specific implementation
- Use RAG for both strategic decisions and tactical "how-to" questions
- Cross-reference multiple sources for validation
- Keep match_count low (2-5) for focused results

## Project Feature Integration

### Feature-Based Organization

**Use features to organize related tasks:**

```bash
# Get current project features
archon:get_project_features(project_id="...")

# Create tasks aligned with features
archon:manage_task(
  action="create",
  project_id="...",
  title="...",
  feature="Consul Integration",
  task_order=8
)
```

### Feature Development Workflow

1. **Feature Planning**: Create feature-specific tasks
2. **Feature Research**: Query for feature-specific patterns
3. **Feature Implementation**: Complete tasks in feature groups
4. **Feature Integration**: Test complete feature functionality

## Error Handling & Recovery

### When Research Yields No Results

**If knowledge queries return empty results:**

1. Broaden search terms and try again
2. Search for related concepts or technologies
3. Document the knowledge gap for future learning
4. Proceed with conservative, well-tested approaches

### When Tasks Become Unclear

**If task scope becomes uncertain:**

1. Break down into smaller, clearer subtasks
2. Research the specific unclear aspects
3. Update task descriptions with new understanding
4. Create parent-child task relationships if needed

### Project Scope Changes

**When requirements evolve:**

1. Create new tasks for additional scope
2. Update existing task priorities (`task_order`)
3. Archive tasks that are no longer relevant
4. Document scope changes in task descriptions

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Research Validation

**Always validate research findings:**

- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Verify recency of information
- Test applicability to current project context
- Document assumptions and limitations

### Task Completion Criteria

**Every task must meet these criteria before marking "done":**

- [ ] Implementation follows researched best practices
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Basic functionality tested
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Commands

### Running Playbooks with Infisical

```bash
# Run playbooks using uv with Infisical secrets
# First, install optional dependencies: uv sync --extra secrets
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml -i inventory/og-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml
```

**CRITICAL**: When working with NetBox or any playbooks that need Infisical secrets:

- ALWAYS use `uv run ansible-playbook` (not `ansible-playbook` directly)
- If you encounter "worker was found in a dead state" errors with Infisical lookups this indicates an error authenticating with the infisical API. You must verify the environment variables are set correctly via .mise.local.toml. The variables needed are INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID and INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET.

- As a last resort, you can get the token via the CLI and use the environment variable:

  ```bash
  # Get token via CLI and use environment variable
  export NETBOX_TOKEN=$(infisical secrets get NETBOX_API_KEY --env=staging --path="/apollo-13/services/netbox" --plain)
  ansible-playbook playbooks/infrastructure/netbox-playbook.yml
  ```

  For detailed Infisical configuration and paths, see `docs/implementation/infisical/infisical-complete-guide.md`

- For localhost-only playbooks (like NetBox API operations), you can skip inventory:

  ```bash
  uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/infrastructure/netbox-dns-discover.yml
  ```

### Working with Dynamic Inventory

```bash
# Test inventory with Infisical (recommended)
uv run ansible-inventory -i inventory/og-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml --list
uv run ansible-inventory -i inventory/doggos-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml --list

# Graph inventory structure
uv run ansible-inventory -i inventory/og-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml --graph
uv run ansible-inventory -i inventory/doggos-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml --graph
```

### Running Assessment Playbooks

```bash
# Infrastructure assessment playbooks (primarily built for doggos-homelab cluster)
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/assessment/consul-health-check.yml -i inventory/doggos-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/assessment/dns-ipam-audit.yml -i inventory/doggos-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/assessment/infrastructure-readiness.yml -i inventory/doggos-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml

# Note: Most playbooks are designed for doggos-homelab. Test carefully before running against og-homelab.
```

### Deploying Nomad Jobs

```bash
# Deploy any Nomad job
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/infrastructure/nomad/deploy-job.yml \
  -i inventory/doggos-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml \
  -e job=nomad-jobs/core-infrastructure/traefik.nomad.hcl

# Deploy Traefik with validation
uv run ansible-playbook playbooks/infrastructure/nomad/deploy-traefik.yml \
  -i inventory/doggos-homelab/infisical.proxmox.yml
```

## Architecture

### Inventory Management

**Directory**: `inventory/` contains all dynamic and static inventory configurations

See [`inventory/README.md`](inventory/README.md) for comprehensive inventory documentation including:

- Current implementation details for Proxmox, Tailscale, Vault, and NetBox inventories
- Environment-specific configurations and host details
- Authentication setup and usage examples
- DNS & IPAM integration status and roadmap

### Nomad Job Management

- **Directory**: `nomad-jobs/` contains all Nomad job specifications
- **Structure**:
  - `core-infrastructure/` - Essential services (Traefik load balancer)
  - `platform-services/` - Infrastructure services (PowerDNS, future NetBox)
  - `applications/` - User-facing applications
- **Deployment**: Using `community.general.nomad_job` Galaxy module via playbooks
- **Port Strategy**: Dynamic ports by default (20000-32000), static only for DNS (53) and load balancer (80/443)

### Python Environment

- Uses `uv` for Python virtual environment management
- All Ansible commands run through `uv run` for consistency
- Dependencies managed in `pyproject.toml`

### Documentation Structure

- `docs/implementation/dns-ipam/implementation-plan.md`: Master plan for DNS & IPAM overhaul:

  - 5-phase implementation approach
  - Detailed task checklists
  - Risk assessments and mitigation strategies
  - Success criteria for each phase

- `docs/implementation/dns-ipam/netbox-integration-patterns.md`: Comprehensive NetBox integration patterns including:

  - Dynamic inventory configuration
  - State management with NetBox modules
  - Runtime data queries with `netbox.netbox.nb_lookup`
  - Event-driven automation patterns

- `docs/implementation/infisical/infisical-complete-guide.md`: Complete Infisical configuration guide:

  - Project setup and authentication
  - Current secret organization at `/apollo-13/` and `/services/`
  - Ansible collection usage patterns and examples
  - Troubleshooting and best practices

### Key Integration Patterns

1. **NetBox as Source of Truth**

   - All network device information should be queried from NetBox
   - Device configurations should be generated based on NetBox data
   - State changes should be reflected back in NetBox

2. **Dynamic Inventory Grouping**

   - Devices grouped by NetBox attributes (site, role, platform, tags)
   - Custom grouping via `keyed_groups` and `compose` directives
   - Ansible variables composed from NetBox custom fields

3. **Secret Management**
   - Never hardcode credentials
   - **Repository Secrets**: Use Infisical for Ansible playbook secrets and credentials
   - **Service Secrets**: Use Vault for lab services and application secrets going forward
   - Environment variables for authentication
   - **Known Issue**: Infisical Ansible collection may fail in virtual environments
   - **Workaround**: Use Infisical CLI to export secrets as environment variables

## Important Considerations

- The project is actively implementing DNS & IPAM infrastructure changes
- Follow the implementation plan in `docs/implementation/dns-ipam/implementation-plan.md`
- Ensure Infisical environment variables are set before running commands (see `docs/implementation/infisical/infisical-complete-guide.md`)
- Use the execution environment for consistency across different systems
- Always test inventory plugins with `ansible-inventory` before running playbooks
- NetBox integration should follow the patterns in `docs/implementation/dns-ipam/netbox-integration-patterns.md`
- **ALWAYS use `uv run` prefix for Ansible commands** to ensure proper Python environment
- NetBox DNS plugin is installed and operational

## Recommended Tools

- For enhanced searching via bash commands use eza, fd, and rg

## Working with Specialized Agents

When working on tasks in this project, follow these guidelines:

### 1. Always Check for Specialized Agents First

Before starting any task, review available agents to see if one matches the work:

**Linting & Code Quality:**

- **lint-master**: Comprehensive linting coordinator for multiple file types
- **ansible-linter**: Ansible playbook and role linting
- **python-linter**: Python code linting and formatting (ruff, mypy, pylint)
- **yaml-linter**: YAML file validation and formatting
- **shell-linter**: Shell script validation with shellcheck
- **hcl-linter**: HCL/Nomad job file validation and formatting
- **markdown-linter**: Markdown documentation formatting and standards

**Project Management & Documentation:**

- **project-orchestrator**: Sprint planning, phase tracking, project management
- **documentation-specialist**: Creating, updating, and organizing documentation
- **commit-craft**: Creating clean, logical commits following conventional standards

**Meta:**

- **meta-agent**: Generates new sub-agent configurations

### 2. Use Specialized Agents Proactively

Don't wait to be asked - if a task matches an agent's description, use it immediately. The agents are designed to handle specific domains more effectively than general-purpose approaches.

### 3. Avoid Defaulting to Direct Implementation

Resist the urge to jump straight into implementation. Take a moment to:

- Consider which agent best fits the task
- Use the agent's specialized knowledge and patterns
- Let agents handle their domains of expertise

This approach ensures better quality, consistency, and adherence to project patterns.
