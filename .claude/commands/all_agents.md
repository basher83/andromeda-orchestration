# List All Agents

List all available agents detailed in your system prompt. Display them in bullet points. Display them in typescript function signature format and suffix the purpose of the agent. Double line break between each agent for readability. Save the output to a file called `all_agents.md` in the `@docs/ai-docs` directory.
