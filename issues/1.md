### Issue: Workflow Permissions Error

The workflow failed due to insufficient permissions for the Code Scanning API endpoints, resulting in the error: **Resource not accessible by integration**. This occurred during the workflow run found [here](https://github.com/basher83/andromeda-orchestration/actions/runs/16616300912/workflow).

#### Recommendation
To resolve this issue, it's recommended to add a permissions block to the workflow YAML file as follows:

```yaml
permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  security-events: write
```

#### Workflow File Reference
This guidance is directly tied to the failure observed in the workflow run. The relevant workflow file can be found in the commit referenced below:
- **Commit SHA**: `23ed2c75c684d35f7baff34fb6fe76f93835a825`

#### How to Add the Permissions Block
To add the permissions block:
1. Open the workflow YAML file located in your repository.
2. Add the permissions block at the top level of the YAML, right after the `name` and `on` keys.

This should help prevent future permissions-related failures in your workflows.
